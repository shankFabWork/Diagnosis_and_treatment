Tests may include:\nA-fib\n\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches (electrodes) are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which displays the test results. An ECG can show if the heart is beating too fast, too slow or not at all. An ECG is the main test for diagnosing atrial fibrillation.\nBlood tests. These help a doctor rule out thyroid problems or detect other substances in the blood that may lead to A-fib.\nHolter monitor. This small, portable ECG device is carried in a pocket or worn on a belt or shoulder strap during regular daily activities. It records the heart's activity continuously for 24 hours or longer.\nEvent recorder. This device is similar to a Holter monitor, but it records only at certain times for a few minutes at a time. It's worn longer than a Holter monitor, typically 30 days. You generally push a button when you feel symptoms. Some devices automatically record when an irregular heart rhythm is detected.\nEchocardiogram. This noninvasive test uses sound waves to create images of the heart's size, structure and motion.\nStress test. Also called exercise testing, stress testing involves running tests on the heart while exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike.\nChest X-ray. X-ray images help a doctor see the condition of the lungs and heart.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and painless test measures the electrical activity of the heart.

Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\nIf A-fib doesn't get better with medications or other therapies, a doctor might recommend a procedure called cardiac ablation. Sometimes ablation is the first treatment for certain patients.\nA-fib\nCardiac ablation uses heat (radiofrequency energy) or extreme cold (cryoablation) to create scars in your heart to block abnormal electrical signals and restore a normal heartbeat. A doctor inserts a flexible tube (catheter) through a blood vessel, usually in your groin, and into your heart. More than one catheter may be used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy.\nLess commonly, ablation is performed using a scalpel during open-heart surgery.\nThere are different types of cardiac ablation. The type used to treat atrial fibrillation depends on your specific symptoms, overall health and whether you're having another heart surgery.\nFor example, some of the types of cardiac ablation that may be used to treat atrial fibrillation are:\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation. Heat or cold energy is applied to the heart tissue at the AV node to destroy the electrical signaling connection. After AV node ablation, a pacemaker is needed for life.\n\nMaze procedure. A doctor uses heat or cold energy or a scalpel to create a pattern of scar tissue (the maze) in the upper chambers of the heart. Because scar tissue doesn't send electrical signals, the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation.\nIf a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open-heart surgery is necessary. This is called the surgical maze procedure. It's the preferred method of atrial fibrillation treatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation.

If this happens, another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment may be recommended. After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes.\nIf a person with A-fib can't take blood-thinning medications, a doctor may recommend a catheter procedure to seal a small sac (appendage) in the left upper heart chamber, where most A-fib related clots form. This procedure is called left atrial appendage closure. A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac. Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed. The device is left permanently in place. Surgery to close the left atrial appendage is an option for some people already having heart surgery.\nA-fib\nA-fib\n",

This method to reset the heart rhythm is done by sending electric shocks to the heart through paddles or patches (electrodes) placed on the chest.\nDrug cardioversion. Medications given through an IV or by mouth are used to reset the heart rhythm.\n\nElectrical cardioversion. This method to reset the heart rhythm is done by sending electric shocks to the heart through paddles or patches (electrodes) placed on the chest.\nElectrical cardioversion.\nDrug cardioversion. Medications given through an IV or by mouth are used to reset the heart rhythm.\nDrug cardioversion.\nCardioversion is usually done in a hospital as a scheduled procedure, but it may be done in emergency situations. If it's scheduled, warfarin (Jantoven) or another blood thinner may be given a few weeks before it's done to reduce the risk of blood clots and strokes.\nAfter electrical cardioversion, anti-arrhythmic medications may be prescribed indefinitely to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\nIf A-fib doesn't get better with medications or other therapies, a doctor might recommend a procedure called cardiac ablation. Sometimes ablation is the first treatment for certain patients.\nA-fib\nCardiac ablation uses heat (radiofrequency energy) or extreme cold (cryoablation) to create scars in your heart to block abnormal electrical signals and restore a normal heartbeat. A doctor inserts a flexible tube (catheter) through a blood vessel, usually in your groin, and into your heart. More than one catheter may be used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy.\nLess commonly, ablation is performed using a scalpel during open-heart surgery.\nThere are different types of cardiac ablation. The type used to treat atrial fibrillation depends on your specific symptoms, overall health and whether you're having another heart surgery.\nFor example, some of the types of cardiac ablation that may be used to treat atrial fibrillation are:\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation. Heat or cold energy is applied to the heart tissue at the AV node to destroy the electrical signaling connection. After AV node ablation, a pacemaker is needed for life.\n\nMaze procedure. A doctor uses heat or cold energy or a scalpel to create a pattern of scar tissue (the maze) in the upper chambers of the heart. Because scar tissue doesn't send electrical signals, the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation.\nIf a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open-heart surgery is necessary. This is called the surgical maze procedure. It's the preferred method of atrial fibrillation treatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation.

If this happens, another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment may be recommended. After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes.\nIf a person with A-fib can't take blood-thinning medications, a doctor may recommend a catheter procedure to seal a small sac (appendage) in the left upper heart chamber, where most A-fib related clots form. This procedure is called left atrial appendage closure. A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac. Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed. The device is left permanently in place. Surgery to close the left atrial appendage is an option for some people already having heart surgery.\nA-fib\nA-fib\nFollowing a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or treat conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Lifestyle changes often include:\n\nEating heart-healthy foods. Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\nExercising regularly. Exercise daily and increase physical activity.\nQuitting smoking. If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to your doctor about strategies or programs to help you break a smoking habit.\nMaintaining a healthy weight. Being overweight increases your risk of developing heart disease. Healthy weight loss can help to manage symptoms of atrial fibrillation and may improve the results of catheter ablation.\nKeeping blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control. Make lifestyle changes and take medications as prescribed to correct high blood pressure (hypertension) or high cholesterol.\nLimiting alcohol. Binge drinking (having five drinks in two hours for men or four drinks for women) can increase the chances of atrial fibrillation. In some people, even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger atrial fibrillation.\nGetting follow-up care. Take your medications as prescribed and have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor.

Because they tend to have more side effects than drugs that control the heart rate, anti-arrhythmics tend to be used more sparingly.\nAnti-arrhythmic medications.\nBlood thinners. To reduce the risk of stroke or damage to other organs caused by blood clots, a doctor may prescribe a blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant). Blood thinners include warfarin (Jantoven), apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). If you take warfarin, you'll need to have regular blood tests to monitor the drug's effects.\nBlood thinners.\nIf A-fib symptoms are bothersome or if this is the first episode of atrial fibrillation, a doctor may attempt to reset the heart rhythm (sinus rhythm) using a procedure called cardioversion.\nA-fib\nCardioversion can be done in two ways:\n\nElectrical cardioversion. This method to reset the heart rhythm is done by sending electric shocks to the heart through paddles or patches (electrodes) placed on the chest.\nDrug cardioversion. Medications given through an IV or by mouth are used to reset the heart rhythm.\n\nElectrical cardioversion.

If it's scheduled, warfarin (Jantoven) or another blood thinner may be given a few weeks before it's done to reduce the risk of blood clots and strokes.\nAfter electrical cardioversion, anti-arrhythmic medications may be prescribed indefinitely to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\nIf A-fib doesn't get better with medications or other therapies, a doctor might recommend a procedure called cardiac ablation. Sometimes ablation is the first treatment for certain patients.\nA-fib\nCardiac ablation uses heat (radiofrequency energy) or extreme cold (cryoablation) to create scars in your heart to block abnormal electrical signals and restore a normal heartbeat. A doctor inserts a flexible tube (catheter) through a blood vessel, usually in your groin, and into your heart. More than one catheter may be used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy.\nLess commonly, ablation is performed using a scalpel during open-heart surgery.\nThere are different types of cardiac ablation. The type used to treat atrial fibrillation depends on your specific symptoms, overall health and whether you're having another heart surgery.\nFor example, some of the types of cardiac ablation that may be used to treat atrial fibrillation are:\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation. Heat or cold energy is applied to the heart tissue at the AV node to destroy the electrical signaling connection. After AV node ablation, a pacemaker is needed for life.\n\nMaze procedure. A doctor uses heat or cold energy or a scalpel to create a pattern of scar tissue (the maze) in the upper chambers of the heart. Because scar tissue doesn't send electrical signals, the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation.\nIf a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open-heart surgery is necessary. This is called the surgical maze procedure. It's the preferred method of atrial fibrillation treatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation.

If this happens, another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment may be recommended. After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes.\nIf a person with A-fib can't take blood-thinning medications, a doctor may recommend a catheter procedure to seal a small sac (appendage) in the left upper heart chamber, where most A-fib related clots form. This procedure is called left atrial appendage closure. A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac. Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed. The device is left permanently in place. Surgery to close the left atrial appendage is an option for some people already having heart surgery.\nA-fib\nA-fib\nFollowing a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or treat conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Lifestyle changes often include:\n\nEating heart-healthy foods. Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\nExercising regularly. Exercise daily and increase physical activity.\nQuitting smoking. If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to your doctor about strategies or programs to help you break a smoking habit.\nMaintaining a healthy weight. Being overweight increases your risk of developing heart disease. Healthy weight loss can help to manage symptoms of atrial fibrillation and may improve the results of catheter ablation.\nKeeping blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control. Make lifestyle changes and take medications as prescribed to correct high blood pressure (hypertension) or high cholesterol.\nLimiting alcohol. Binge drinking (having five drinks in two hours for men or four drinks for women) can increase the chances of atrial fibrillation. In some people, even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger atrial fibrillation.\nGetting follow-up care. Take your medications as prescribed and have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor.

This noninvasive test uses sound waves to create images of the heart's size, structure and motion.\nEchocardiogram.\nStress test. Also called exercise testing, stress testing involves running tests on the heart while exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike.\nStress test.\nChest X-ray. X-ray images help a doctor see the condition of the lungs and heart.\nChest X-ray.\nTreatment for atrial fibrillation depends on how long you've had A-fib, your symptoms and the underlying cause of the heartbeat problem. The goals of treatment are to:\nA-fib\n\nReset the heart rhythm\nControl the heart rate\nPrevent blood clots that can lead to stroke\n\nReset the heart rhythm\nControl the heart rate\nPrevent blood clots that can lead to stroke\nAtrial fibrillation treatment may involve:\n\nMedications\nTherapy to reset the heart rhythm (cardioversion)\nSurgery or catheter procedures\n\nMedications\nTherapy to reset the heart rhythm (cardioversion)\nSurgery or catheter procedures\nTogether, you and your doctors will discuss the best treatment option for you. It's important to follow your atrial fibrillation treatment plan. If A-fib isn't well controlled, it may lead to other complications, including strokes and heart failure.\nA-fib\nYou may be prescribed medications to control how fast your heart beats and restore it to a normal rate. Medications are also prescribed to prevent blood clots, a dangerous complication of A-fib.\nA-fib\nMedications used to treat atrial fibrillation include:\n\nBeta blockers. These medications can help slow the heart rate at rest and during activity.\nCalcium channel blockers. These medicines control the heart rate but may need to be avoided by those who have heart failure or low blood pressure.\nDigoxin. This medication may control the heart rate at rest, but not as well during activity. Most people need additional or alternative medications, such as calcium channel blockers or beta blockers.\nAnti-arrhythmic medications. These drugs are used to maintain a normal heart rhythm, not just to control the heart rate. Because they tend to have more side effects than drugs that control the heart rate, anti-arrhythmics tend to be used more sparingly.\nBlood thinners. To reduce the risk of stroke or damage to other organs caused by blood clots, a doctor may prescribe a blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant). Blood thinners include warfarin (Jantoven), apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). If you take warfarin, you'll need to have regular blood tests to monitor the drug's effects.\n\nBeta blockers.

This method to reset the heart rhythm is done by sending electric shocks to the heart through paddles or patches (electrodes) placed on the chest.\nDrug cardioversion. Medications given through an IV or by mouth are used to reset the heart rhythm.\n\nElectrical cardioversion. This method to reset the heart rhythm is done by sending electric shocks to the heart through paddles or patches (electrodes) placed on the chest.\nElectrical cardioversion.\nDrug cardioversion. Medications given through an IV or by mouth are used to reset the heart rhythm.\nDrug cardioversion.\nCardioversion is usually done in a hospital as a scheduled procedure, but it may be done in emergency situations. If it's scheduled, warfarin (Jantoven) or another blood thinner may be given a few weeks before it's done to reduce the risk of blood clots and strokes.\nAfter electrical cardioversion, anti-arrhythmic medications may be prescribed indefinitely to help prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Even with medications, there is a chance of another episode of atrial fibrillation.\nIf A-fib doesn't get better with medications or other therapies, a doctor might recommend a procedure called cardiac ablation. Sometimes ablation is the first treatment for certain patients.\nA-fib\nCardiac ablation uses heat (radiofrequency energy) or extreme cold (cryoablation) to create scars in your heart to block abnormal electrical signals and restore a normal heartbeat. A doctor inserts a flexible tube (catheter) through a blood vessel, usually in your groin, and into your heart. More than one catheter may be used. Sensors on the tip of the catheter apply the cold or heat energy.\nLess commonly, ablation is performed using a scalpel during open-heart surgery.\nThere are different types of cardiac ablation. The type used to treat atrial fibrillation depends on your specific symptoms, overall health and whether you're having another heart surgery.\nFor example, some of the types of cardiac ablation that may be used to treat atrial fibrillation are:\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation. Heat or cold energy is applied to the heart tissue at the AV node to destroy the electrical signaling connection. After AV node ablation, a pacemaker is needed for life.\n\nMaze procedure. A doctor uses heat or cold energy or a scalpel to create a pattern of scar tissue (the maze) in the upper chambers of the heart. Because scar tissue doesn't send electrical signals, the maze interferes with the stray heart signals that cause atrial fibrillation.\nIf a scalpel is used to create the maze pattern, open-heart surgery is necessary. This is called the surgical maze procedure. It's the preferred method of atrial fibrillation treatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\n\n\nAtrioventricular (AV) node ablation.

It's the preferred method of atrial fibrillation treatment in those who need another heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass surgery or heart valve repair.\nAtrial fibrillation may return after cardiac ablation. If this happens, another cardiac ablation or other heart treatment may be recommended. After cardiac ablation, lifelong blood thinners may be needed to prevent strokes.\nIf a person with A-fib can't take blood-thinning medications, a doctor may recommend a catheter procedure to seal a small sac (appendage) in the left upper heart chamber, where most A-fib related clots form. This procedure is called left atrial appendage closure. A closure device is gently guided through a catheter to the sac. Once the device is in place, the catheter is removed. The device is left permanently in place. Surgery to close the left atrial appendage is an option for some people already having heart surgery.\nA-fib\nA-fib\nFollowing a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent or treat conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Lifestyle changes often include:\n\nEating heart-healthy foods. Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\nExercising regularly. Exercise daily and increase physical activity.\nQuitting smoking. If you smoke and can't quit on your own, talk to your doctor about strategies or programs to help you break a smoking habit.\nMaintaining a healthy weight. Being overweight increases your risk of developing heart disease. Healthy weight loss can help to manage symptoms of atrial fibrillation and may improve the results of catheter ablation.\nKeeping blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control. Make lifestyle changes and take medications as prescribed to correct high blood pressure (hypertension) or high cholesterol.\nLimiting alcohol. Binge drinking (having five drinks in two hours for men or four drinks for women) can increase the chances of atrial fibrillation. In some people, even modest amounts of alcohol can trigger atrial fibrillation.\nGetting follow-up care. Take your medications as prescribed and have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor. Tell your doctor if your symptoms worsen.\n\nEating heart-healthy foods.

If atrial fibrillation is found early, treatment may be easier and more effective. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart conditions (cardiologist).\nBecause appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your dietary intake. You may need to do this if your doctor orders blood tests.\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to atrial fibrillation.\nWrite down key personal information, including any family history of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure or diabetes, and any major stresses or recent life changes.\nMake a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements that you're taking.\nTake a family member or friend along, if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to understand and remember all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.\nWrite down questions to ask your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.

List your questions from most important to least important, in case time runs out. For atrial fibrillation, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\nWhat are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\nWhat kinds of tests will I need?\nWhat's the most appropriate treatment?\nWhat foods should I eat or avoid?\nWhat's an appropriate level of physical activity?\nHow often should I be screened for heart disease or other complications of atrial fibrillation?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nI have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\nAre there any restrictions that I need to follow?\nShould I see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover seeing a specialist? (You may need to ask your insurance provider directly for information about coverage.)\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?\nAre there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend visiting?\n\nWhat is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\nWhat are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\nWhat kinds of tests will I need?\nWhat's the most appropriate treatment?\nWhat foods should I eat or avoid?\nWhat's an appropriate level of physical activity?\nHow often should I be screened for heart disease or other complications of atrial fibrillation?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nI have other health conditions.

Which treatment you have depends on the size of the aortic aneurysm and how fast it's growing.\nA doctor might recommend this option, also called watchful waiting, if the abdominal aortic aneurysm is small and isn't causing symptoms. Monitoring requires regular doctor's checkups and imaging tests to determine if the aneurysm is growing and to manage other conditions, such as high blood pressure, that could worsen the aneurysm.\nTypically, a person who has a small, symptomless abdominal aortic aneurysm needs an abdominal ultrasound at least six months after diagnosis and at regular follow-up appointments.\nSurgery to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm is generally recommended if the aneurysm is 1.9 to 2.2 inches (4.8 to 5.6 centimeters) or larger, or if it's growing quickly.\nAlso, a doctor might recommend abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery if you have symptoms such as stomach pain or you have a leaking, tender or painful aneurysm.\nThe type of surgery performed depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, your age, and your overall health. Abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery options may include:\n\n\nEndovascular repair. This procedure is used most often to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through an artery in the leg and gently guides it to the aorta. A metal mesh tube (graft) on the end of the catheter is placed at the site of the aneurysm, expanded and fastened in place. The graft strengthens the weakened section of the aorta to prevent rupture of the aneurysm.\nEndovascular surgery isn't an option for everyone with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. You and your doctor will discuss the best repair option for you. After endovascular surgery, you'll need regular imaging tests to ensure that the grafted area isn't leaking.\n\nOpen abdominal surgery. This involves removing the damaged part of the aorta and replacing it with a graft, which is sewn into place. Full recovery may take a month or more.\n\n\nEndovascular repair.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often found when a physical exam is done for another reason or during routine medical tests, such as an ultrasound of the heart or abdomen.\nTo diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a doctor will examine you and review your medical and family history. If your doctor thinks that you may have an aortic aneurysm, imaging tests are done to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTests to diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm include:\n\n\nAbdominal ultrasound. This is the most common test to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms. An abdominal ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to show how blood flows through the structures in the belly area, including the aorta.\nDuring an abdominal ultrasound, a technician gently presses an ultrasound wand (transducer) against the belly area, moving it back and forth. The device sends signals to a computer, which creates images.\n\n\nAbdominal CT scan. This painless test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the structures inside the belly area. It's used to create clear images of the aorta. An abdominal CT scan can also detect the size and shape of an aneurysm.\nDuring a CT scan, you lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine. Sometimes, dye (contrast material) is given through a vein to make your blood vessels show up more clearly on the images.\n\nAbdominal MRI. This imaging test uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the structures inside your belly area. Sometimes, dye (contrast material) is given through a vein to make your blood vessels more visible.\n\n\nAbdominal ultrasound. This is the most common test to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms.

A prescription cream that contains glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head.\nNerve-blocking medications. Some oral medications block the chemicals that permit certain nerves to communicate with each other. This can reduce sweating in some people. Possible side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and bladder problems.\nAntidepressants. Some medications used for depression can also decrease sweating. In addition, they may help decrease the anxiety that worsens the hyperhidrosis.\nBotulinum toxin injections. Treatment with botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc, others) temporarily blocks the nerves that cause sweating. Your skin will be iced or anesthetized first.

                "What you can do": "During your appointment, your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. You may also need a physical exam or tests to further evaluate the cause of your condition.\nYour doctor may recommend blood, urine or other lab tests to see if your sweating is caused by another medical condition, such as an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).\n\nA number of tests are available to pinpoint the areas of sweating and estimate the severity of your condition, including an iodine-starch test, skin conductance and a thermoregulatory sweat test.\nIf an underlying medical condition is contributing to the problem, that condition will be treated first. If no clear cause can be found, treatment focuses on controlling excessive sweating. Sometimes you may need to try a combination of treatments. And even if your sweating improves after treatment, it may recur.\nDrugs used to treat hyperhidrosis include:\n\nPrescription antiperspirant. Your doctor may prescribe an antiperspirant with aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac Ac). This product can cause skin and eye irritation. It's usually applied to the affected skin before you go to bed. Then you wash the product off when you get up, taking care to not get any in your eyes. If your skin becomes irritated, hydrocortisone cream might help.\nPrescription creams. A prescription cream that contains glycopyrrolate may help hyperhidrosis that affects the face and head.\nNerve-blocking medications. Some oral medications block the chemicals that permit certain nerves to communicate with each other. This can reduce sweating in some people. Possible side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision and bladder problems.\nAntidepressants. Some medications used for depression can also decrease sweating. In addition, they may help decrease the anxiety that worsens the hyperhidrosis.\nBotulinum toxin injections. Treatment with botulinum toxin (Botox, Myobloc, others) temporarily blocks the nerves that cause sweating. Your skin will be iced or anesthetized first. Each affected area of your body will need several injections. The effects last six to 12 months, and then the treatment needs to be repeated. This treatment can be painful, and some people experience temporary muscle weakness in the treated area.\n\nPrescription antiperspirant.

With this therapy, a device that delivers microwave energy is used to destroy sweat glands. Treatments involve two 20- to 30-minute sessions, three months apart. Possible side effects are a change in skin sensation and some discomfort. This therapy may be expensive and not widely available.\nSweat gland removal. If excessive sweating occurs just in your armpits, removing the sweat glands there may help. A minimally invasive technique called suction curettage may be an option, too, if you aren't responding to other treatments.\nNerve surgery (sympathectomy). During this procedure, the surgeon cuts, burns or clamps the spinal nerves that control sweating in your hands. In some cases, this procedure triggers excessive sweating in other areas of your body (compensatory sweating). Surgery is generally not an option for isolated head and neck sweating. A variation on this procedure interrupts the nerve signals without removing the sympathetic nerve (sympathotomy).\n\nMicrowave therapy.

Nonprescription antiperspirants contain aluminum-based compounds that temporarily block the sweat pore. This reduces the amount of sweat that reaches your skin. This type of product may help with minor hyperhidrosis.\nApply astringents. Apply over-the-counter products containing tannic acid (Zilactin) to the affected area.\nBathe daily.

When needed, treatment depends on the size of the cyst, your discomfort level and whether it's infected, which can result in an abscess.\nTreatment options your doctor may recommend include:\n\nSitz baths. Soaking in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water (sitz bath) several times a day for three or four days may help a small, infected cyst to rupture and drain on its own.\n\nSurgical drainage. You may need surgery to drain a cyst that's infected or very large. Drainage of a cyst can be done using local anesthesia or sedation.\nFor the procedure, your doctor makes a small incision in the cyst, allows it to drain, and then places a small rubber tube (catheter) in the incision. The catheter stays in place for up to six weeks to keep the incision open and allow complete drainage.\n\nAntibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if your cyst is infected or if testing reveals that you have a sexually transmitted infection. But if the abscess is drained properly, you may not need antibiotics.\nMarsupialization. If cysts recur or bother you, a marsupialization (mahr-soo-pee-ul-ih-ZAY-shun) procedure may help. Your doctor places stitches on each side of a drainage incision to create a permanent opening less than 1/4-inch (about 6-millimeter) long. An inserted catheter may be placed to promote drainage for a few days after the procedure and to help prevent recurrence.\n\nSitz baths.

Your doctor places stitches on each side of a drainage incision to create a permanent opening less than 1/4-inch (about 6-millimeter) long. An inserted catheter may be placed to promote drainage for a few days after the procedure and to help prevent recurrence.\nMarsupialization.\nRarely, for persistent cysts that aren't effectively treated by the above procedures, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the Bartholin's gland. Surgical removal is usually done in a hospital under general anesthesia. Surgical removal of the gland carries a greater risk of bleeding or complications after the procedure.\nDaily soaking in warm water, several times a day, may be adequate to resolve an infected Bartholin's cyst or abscess.\nAfter a surgical procedure to treat an infected cyst or abscess, soaking in warm water is particularly important. Sitz baths help to keep the area clean, ease discomfort and promote effective drainage of the cyst. Pain relievers also may be helpful.\nYour first appointment will likely be with either your primary care provider or a doctor who specializes in conditions that affect women (gynecologist).\nTo prepare for your appointment:\n\nWrite down your symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to your condition.\nMake a list of any medications, vitamins or supplements that you take along with the dosages.\nTake a notebook or notepad with you to write down information during your visit.\nPrepare questions to ask your doctor, listing the most important questions first to be sure you cover them.\n\nWrite down your symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to your condition.\nWrite down your symptoms,\nMake a list of any medications, vitamins or supplements that you take along with the dosages.\nMake a list of any medications, vitamins or supplements\nTake a notebook or notepad with you to write down information during your visit.\nTake a notebook or notepad with you\nPrepare questions to ask your doctor, listing the most important questions first to be sure you cover them.\nPrepare questions to ask your doctor,\nFor a Bartholin's cyst, some basic questions to ask include:\n\nWhat's likely causing my symptoms?\nWhat kind of tests might I need?\nWill the cyst go away on its own, or will I need treatment?\nHow long should I wait after treatment before having sex?\nWhat self-care measures might help relieve my symptoms?\nWill the cyst come back again?\nDo you have any printed material or brochures I can take home with me?

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include:\n\n\n\nElectroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap.\nRapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern.\n\nBrain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation.\n\n\nElectroencephalography (EEG).

To test for achalasia, your doctor is likely to recommend:\n\nEsophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow, the coordination and force exerted by the esophagus muscles, and how well your lower esophageal sphincter relaxes or opens during a swallow. This test is the most helpful when determining which type of motility problem you might have.\nX-rays of your upper digestive system (esophagram). X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help to show a blockage of the esophagus.\nUpper endoscopy. Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy can be used to define a partial blockage of the esophagus if your symptoms or results of a barium study indicate that possibility. Endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications of reflux such as Barrett's esophagus.\n\nEsophageal manometry.

A balloon is inserted by endoscopy into the center of the esophageal sphincter and inflated to enlarge the opening. This outpatient procedure may need to be repeated if the esophageal sphincter doesn't stay open. Nearly one-third of people treated with balloon dilation need repeat treatment within five years. This procedure requires sedation.\n\nBotox (botulinum toxin type A). This muscle relaxant can be injected directly into the esophageal sphincter with an endoscopic needle. The injections may need to be repeated, and repeat injections may make it more difficult to perform surgery later if needed.\nBotox is generally recommended only for people who aren't good candidates for pneumatic dilation or surgery due to age or overall health. Botox injections typically do not last more than six months. A strong improvement from injection of Botox may help confirm a diagnosis of achalasia.\n\nMedication. Your doctor might suggest muscle relaxants such as nitroglycerin (Nitrostat) or nifedipine (Procardia) before eating. These medications have limited treatment effect and severe side effects. Medications are generally considered only if you're not a candidate for pneumatic dilation or surgery, and Botox hasn't helped. This type of therapy is rarely indicated.\n\nPneumatic dilation.

This type of therapy is rarely indicated.\nMedication.\nSurgical options for treating achalasia include:\n\n\nHeller myotomy. The surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter to allow food to pass more easily into the stomach. The procedure can be done noninvasively (laparoscopic Heller myotomy). Some people who have a Heller myotomy may later develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nTo avoid future problems with GERD, a procedure known as fundoplication might be performed at the same time as a Heller myotomy. In fundoplication, the surgeon wraps the top of your stomach around the lower esophagus to create an anti-reflux valve, preventing acid from coming back (GERD) into the esophagus. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure.\n\n\nPeroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). In the POEM procedure, the surgeon uses an endoscope inserted through your mouth and down your throat to create an incision in the inside lining of your esophagus. Then, as in a Heller myotomy, the surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophageal sphincter.\nPOEM may also be combined with or followed by later fundoplication to help prevent GERD. Some patients who have a POEM and develop GERD after the procedure are treated with daily oral medication.\n\n\n\nHeller myotomy.

Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications. An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett's esophagus.\nAmbulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that you wear around your waist or with a strap over your shoulder. The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that's threaded through your nose into your esophagus, or a clip that's placed in your esophagus during an endoscopy and that gets passed into your stool after about two days.\nEsophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus.\nX-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that may interfere with swallowing.\n\nUpper endoscopy.

An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett's esophagus.\nAmbulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there.

                "Questions to ask your doctor": "Your doctor might be able to diagnose GERD based on a physical examination and history of your signs and symptoms.\nGERD\nTo confirm a diagnosis of GERD, or to check for complications, your doctor might recommend:\nGERD\n\n\nUpper endoscopy. Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications. An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett's esophagus.\nAmbulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that you wear around your waist or with a strap over your shoulder. The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that's threaded through your nose into your esophagus, or a clip that's placed in your esophagus during an endoscopy and that gets passed into your stool after about two days.\nEsophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus.\nX-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that may interfere with swallowing.\n\nUpper endoscopy.

If you don't experience relief within a few weeks, your doctor might recommend prescription medication or surgery.\nThe options include:\n\nAntacids that neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems.\nMedications to reduce acid production. These medications — known as H-2-receptor blockers — include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid AR). H-2-receptor blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.\nMedications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications — known as proton pump inhibitors — are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC).\n\nAntacids that neutralize stomach acid.

Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat, to examine the inside of your esophagus and stomach. Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications. An endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett's esophagus.\nAmbulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that you wear around your waist or with a strap over your shoulder. The monitor might be a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that's threaded through your nose into your esophagus, or a clip that's placed in your esophagus during an endoscopy and that gets passed into your stool after about two days.\nEsophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus.\nX-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. You may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that may interfere with swallowing.\n\nUpper endoscopy.

Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems.\nMedications to reduce acid production. These medications — known as H-2-receptor blockers — include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid AR). H-2-receptor blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.\nMedications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications — known as proton pump inhibitors — are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC).\n\nAntacids that neutralize stomach acid.

Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. The wrapping of the top part of the stomach can be partial or complete.\nLINX device. A ring of tiny magnetic beads is wrapped around the junction of the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction between the beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to refluxing acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. The LINX device can be implanted using minimally invasive surgery.\n\nTransoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF). This new procedure involves tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by creating a partial wrap around the lower esophagus using polypropylene fasteners. TIF is performed through the mouth with a device called an endoscope and requires no surgical incision. Its advantages include quick recovery time and high tolerance.\nIf you have a large hiatal hernia, TIF alone is not an option.

Smoking decreases the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to function properly.\nElevate the head of your bed. If you regularly experience heartburn while trying to sleep, place wood or cement blocks under the feet of your bed so that the head end is raised by 6 to 9 inches. If you can't elevate your bed, you can insert a wedge between your mattress and box spring to elevate your body from the waist up. Raising your head with additional pillows isn't effective.\nDon't lie down after a meal. Wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed.\nEat food slowly and chew thoroughly. Put down your fork after every bite and pick it up again once you have chewed and swallowed that bite.\nAvoid foods and drinks that trigger reflux. Common triggers include fatty or fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion, and caffeine.\nAvoid tight-fitting clothing.

Successful ACL reconstruction paired with rigorous rehabilitation can usually restore stability and function to your knee.\nACL\nThere's no set time frame for athletes to return to play. Recent research indicates that up to one-third of athletes sustain another tear in the same or opposite knee within two years. A longer recovery period may reduce the risk of re-injury.\nIn general, it takes as long as a year or more before athletes can safely return to play. Doctors and physical therapists will perform tests to gauge your knee's stability, strength, function and readiness to return to sports activities at various intervals during your rehabilitation. It's important to ensure that strength, stability and movement patterns are optimized before you return to an activity with a risk of ACL injury.\nACL\nThe pain and disability associated with an ACL injury prompt many people to seek immediate medical attention. Others may make an appointment with their family doctors. Depending on the severity of your injury, you may be referred to a doctor specializing in sports medicine or a specialist in bone and joint surgery (orthopedic surgeon). \nACL\nBefore an appointment, be prepared to answer the following questions:\n\nWhen did the injury occur?\nWhat were you doing at the time?\nDid you hear a loud pop or feel a \"popping\" sensation?\nWas there much swelling afterward?\nHave you injured your knee before?\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nDo any specific movements seem to improve or worsen your symptoms?\nDoes your knee ever \"lock\" or feel blocked when you're trying to move it?\nDo you ever feel that your knee is unstable or unable to support your weight?\n\nWhen did the injury occur?\nWhat were you doing at the time?\nDid you hear a loud pop or feel a \"popping\" sensation?\nWas there much swelling afterward?\nHave you injured your knee before?\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nDo any specific movements seem to improve or worsen your symptoms?\nDoes your knee ever \"lock\" or feel blocked when you're trying to move it?\nDo you ever feel that your knee is unstable or unable to support your weight?\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\nThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\nTopical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n\nAntibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n\nAzelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.\nSalicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.\n\nDapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs.

For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria. Usually the first choice for treating acne is a tetracycline (minocycline, doxycycline) or a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin). A macrolide might be an option for people who can't take tetracyclines, including pregnant women and children under 8 years old.\nOral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance. And they should be combined with other drugs, such as benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.\nSevere side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon. These drugs do increase your skin's sun sensitivity.\n\n\nCombined oral contraceptives. Four combined oral contraceptives are approved by the FDA for acne therapy in women who also wish to use them for contraception. They are products that combine progestin and estrogen (Ortho Tri-Cyclen 21, Yaz, others). You may not see the benefit of this treatment for a few months, so using other acne medications with it for the first few weeks may help.\nCommon side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n\nAnti-androgen agents. The drug spironolactone (Aldactone) may be considered for women and adolescent girls if oral antibiotics aren't helping. It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil-producing glands. Possible side effects include breast tenderness and painful periods.\n\nIsotretinoin. Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others) is a derivative of vitamin A. It may be prescribed for people whose moderate or severe acne hasn't responded to other treatments.\nPotential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects.

                "Treating children": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\nThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\nTopical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n\nAntibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance.

                "Lifestyle and home remedies": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\nThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\nTopical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n\nAntibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n\nAzelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.\nSalicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.\n\nDapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs.

                "Preparing for your appointment": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\nThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\nTopical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n\nAntibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n\nAzelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties.

Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne.

                "What you can do": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\nThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\nTopical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity. They can also cause dry skin and redness, especially in people with skin of color. Adapalene may be tolerated best.\n\nAntibiotics. These work by killing excess skin bacteria and reducing redness and inflammation. For the first few months of treatment, you may use both a retinoid and an antibiotic, with the antibiotic applied in the morning and the retinoid in the evening. The antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the likelihood of developing antibiotic resistance. Examples include clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzaclin, Duac, others) and erythromycin with benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin). Topical antibiotics alone aren't recommended.\n\nAzelaic acid and salicylic acid. Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring acid produced by a yeast. It has antibacterial properties. A 20% azelaic acid cream or gel seems to be as effective as many conventional acne treatments when used twice a day. Prescription azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) is an option during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. It can also be used to manage discoloration that occurs with some types of acne. Side effects include skin redness and minor skin irritation.\nSalicylic acid may help prevent plugged hair follicles and is available as both wash-off and leave-on products. Studies showing its effectiveness are limited. Side effects include skin discoloration and minor skin irritation.\n\nDapsone. Dapsone (Aczone) 5% gel twice daily is recommended for inflammatory acne, especially in women with acne. Side effects include redness and dryness.\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions.

For moderate to severe acne, you may need oral antibiotics to reduce bacteria. Usually the first choice for treating acne is a tetracycline (minocycline, doxycycline) or a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin). A macrolide might be an option for people who can't take tetracyclines, including pregnant women and children under 8 years old.\nOral antibiotics should be used for the shortest time possible to prevent antibiotic resistance. And they should be combined with other drugs, such as benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.\nSevere side effects from the use of antibiotics to treat acne are uncommon. These drugs do increase your skin's sun sensitivity.\n\n\nCombined oral contraceptives. Four combined oral contraceptives are approved by the FDA for acne therapy in women who also wish to use them for contraception. They are products that combine progestin and estrogen (Ortho Tri-Cyclen 21, Yaz, others). You may not see the benefit of this treatment for a few months, so using other acne medications with it for the first few weeks may help.\nCommon side effects of combined oral contraceptives are weight gain, breast tenderness and nausea. These drugs are also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular problems, breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n\nAnti-androgen agents. The drug spironolactone (Aldactone) may be considered for women and adolescent girls if oral antibiotics aren't helping. It works by blocking the effect of androgen hormones on the oil-producing glands. Possible side effects include breast tenderness and painful periods.\n\nIsotretinoin. Isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis, others) is a derivative of vitamin A. It may be prescribed for people whose moderate or severe acne hasn't responded to other treatments.\nPotential side effects of oral isotretinoin include inflammatory bowel disease, depression and severe birth defects. All people receiving isotretinoin must participate in an FDA-approved risk management program. And they'll need to see their doctors regularly to monitor for side effects.\n\n\n\nAntibiotics.

A variety of light-based therapies have been tried with some success. Most will require multiple visits to your doctor's office. Further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose.\nChemical peel. This procedure uses repeated applications of a chemical solution, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid or retinoic acid. This treatment is for mild acne. It might improve the appearance of the skin, though the change is not long lasting and repeat treatments are usually needed.\nDrainage and extraction. Your doctor may use special tools to gently remove whiteheads and blackheads (comedos) or cysts that haven't cleared up with topical medications. This technique temporarily improves the appearance of your skin, but it might also cause scarring.\nSteroid injection. Nodular and cystic lesions can be treated by injecting a steroid drug into them. This therapy has resulted in rapid improvement and decreased pain. Side effects may include skin thinning and discoloration in the treated area.\n\nLight therapy.

Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.\nSome alternative and integrative medicine approaches might be helpful in reducing acne:\n\nTea tree oil. Gels containing at least 5% tea tree oil may be as effective as lotions containing 5% benzoyl peroxide, although tea tree oil might work more slowly. Possible side effects include minor itching, burning, redness and dryness, which make it a poor choice for people with rosacea.\nBrewer's yeast. A strain of brewer's yeast called Hansen CBS seems to help decrease acne when taken orally. It may cause gas (flatulence).\n\nTea tree oil.

Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.\nSome alternative and integrative medicine approaches might be helpful in reducing acne:\n\nTea tree oil. Gels containing at least 5% tea tree oil may be as effective as lotions containing 5% benzoyl peroxide, although tea tree oil might work more slowly. Possible side effects include minor itching, burning, redness and dryness, which make it a poor choice for people with rosacea.\nBrewer's yeast.

Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of specific treatments before you try them.\nYou can try to avoid or control mild or moderate acne with nonprescription products, good basic skin care and other self-care techniques:\n\n\nWash problem areas with a gentle cleanser. Twice a day, use your hands to wash your face with mild soap or a gentle cleanser (Cetaphil, Vanicream, others) and warm water. If your hair is oily, shampoo every day. And be gentle if you're shaving affected skin.\nAvoid certain products, such as facial scrubs, astringents and masks. They tend to irritate the skin, which can worsen acne. Too much washing and scrubbing also can irritate the skin.\n\n\nTry over-the-counter acne products to dry excess oil and promote peeling. Look for products containing benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. You might also try products containing salicylic acid, glycolic acid or alpha hydroxy acids. It may take a few weeks of using a product before you see any improvement.\nCreams are less irritating than gels or ointments. Nonprescription acne medications may cause initial side effects — such as redness, dryness and scaling — that often improve after the first month of using them.\n\nAvoid irritants. Oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hairstyling products or acne concealers can worsen acne. Instead, use products labeled water-based or noncomedogenic, which means they are less likely to cause acne.\nProtect your skin from the sun. For some people, the sun worsens the discoloration that sometimes lingers after the acne has cleared. And some acne medications make you more susceptible to sunburn. Check with your doctor to see if your medication is one of these. If it is, stay out of the sun as much as possible. Regularly use a nonoily (noncomedogenic) moisturizer that includes a sunscreen.\nAvoid friction or pressure on your skin. Protect your acne-prone skin from contact with items such as phones, helmets, tight collars or straps, and backpacks.\nAvoid touching or picking acne-prone areas. Doing so can trigger more acne or lead to infection or scarring.\nShower after strenuous activities. Oil and sweat on your skin can lead to breakouts.\n\n\nWash problem areas with a gentle cleanser.

                "Reprint Permissions": "If you've tried over-the-counter (nonprescription) acne products for several weeks and they haven't helped, ask your doctor about prescription-strength medications. A dermatologist can help you:\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nControl your acne\nAvoid scarring or other damage to your skin\nMake scars less noticeable\n\nAcne medications work by reducing oil production and swelling or by treating bacterial infection. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely.\nThe treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are often used in combination. Treatment options for pregnant women are limited due to the risk of side effects.\nTalk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering. And make follow-up appointments with your doctor every three to six months until your skin improves.\nThe most common topical prescription medications for acne are:\n\n\nRetinoids and retinoid-like drugs. Drugs that contain retinoic acids or tretinoin are often useful for moderate acne. These come as creams, gels and lotions. Examples include tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others). You apply this medication in the evening, beginning with three times a week, then daily as your skin becomes used to it. It prevents plugging of hair follicles. Do not apply tretinoin at the same time as benzoyl peroxide.\nTopical retinoids increase your skin's sun sensitivity.

And they'll need to see their doctors regularly to monitor for side effects.\nFDA\nFor some people, the following therapies might be helpful, either alone or in combination with medications.\n\nLight therapy. A variety of light-based therapies have been tried with some success. Most will require multiple visits to your doctor's office. Further study is needed to determine the ideal method, light source and dose.\nChemical peel. This procedure uses repeated applications of a chemical solution, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid or retinoic acid. This treatment is for mild acne. It might improve the appearance of the skin, though the change is not long lasting and repeat treatments are usually needed.\nDrainage and extraction. Your doctor may use special tools to gently remove whiteheads and blackheads (comedos) or cysts that haven't cleared up with topical medications. This technique temporarily improves the appearance of your skin, but it might also cause scarring.\nSteroid injection. Nodular and cystic lesions can be treated by injecting a steroid drug into them. This therapy has resulted in rapid improvement and decreased pain. Side effects may include skin thinning and discoloration in the treated area.\n\nLight therapy.

Increasingly, younger children are getting acne as well. The FDA has expanded the number of topical products approved for use in children. And guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology indicate that topical benzoyl peroxide, adapalene and tretinoin in preadolescent children are effective and don't cause increased risk of side effects.\nFDA\nIf your child has acne, consider consulting a pediatric dermatologist. Ask about drugs to avoid in children, appropriate doses, drug interactions, side effects, and how treatment may affect a child's growth and development.\nSome alternative and integrative medicine approaches might be helpful in reducing acne:\n\nTea tree oil. Gels containing at least 5% tea tree oil may be as effective as lotions containing 5% benzoyl peroxide, although tea tree oil might work more slowly. Possible side effects include minor itching, burning, redness and dryness, which make it a poor choice for people with rosacea.\nBrewer's yeast. A strain of brewer's yeast called Hansen CBS seems to help decrease acne when taken orally. It may cause gas (flatulence).\n\nTea tree oil.

Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of specific treatments before you try them.\nYou can try to avoid or control mild or moderate acne with nonprescription products, good basic skin care and other self-care techniques:\n\n\nWash problem areas with a gentle cleanser. Twice a day, use your hands to wash your face with mild soap or a gentle cleanser (Cetaphil, Vanicream, others) and warm water. If your hair is oily, shampoo every day. And be gentle if you're shaving affected skin.\nAvoid certain products, such as facial scrubs, astringents and masks. They tend to irritate the skin, which can worsen acne. Too much washing and scrubbing also can irritate the skin.\n\n\nTry over-the-counter acne products to dry excess oil and promote peeling. Look for products containing benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. You might also try products containing salicylic acid, glycolic acid or alpha hydroxy acids. It may take a few weeks of using a product before you see any improvement.\nCreams are less irritating than gels or ointments. Nonprescription acne medications may cause initial side effects — such as redness, dryness and scaling — that often improve after the first month of using them.\n\nAvoid irritants. Oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hairstyling products or acne concealers can worsen acne. Instead, use products labeled water-based or noncomedogenic, which means they are less likely to cause acne.\nProtect your skin from the sun. For some people, the sun worsens the discoloration that sometimes lingers after the acne has cleared. And some acne medications make you more susceptible to sunburn. Check with your doctor to see if your medication is one of these. If it is, stay out of the sun as much as possible. Regularly use a nonoily (noncomedogenic) moisturizer that includes a sunscreen.\nAvoid friction or pressure on your skin. Protect your acne-prone skin from contact with items such as phones, helmets, tight collars or straps, and backpacks.\nAvoid touching or picking acne-prone areas. Doing so can trigger more acne or lead to infection or scarring.\nShower after strenuous activities. Oil and sweat on your skin can lead to breakouts.\n\n\nWash problem areas with a gentle cleanser.

Try to manage stress by getting enough sleep and practicing relaxation techniques.\nIf you have acne that's not responding to self-care and over-the-counter treatments, make an appointment with your doctor. Early, effective treatment of acne reduces the risk of scarring and of lasting damage to your self-esteem. After an initial examination, your doctor may refer you to a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions (dermatologist).\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\n\nList your key medical information, such as other conditions you're dealing with and any prescription or over-the-counter products you're using, including vitamins and supplements.\nList key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.\nList questions to ask your doctor.

Monitoring may be recommended if you're an older adult or otherwise not a good candidate for more-aggressive treatment.\nYour doctor may recommend that you have regular imaging and hearing tests, usually every 6 to 12 months, to determine whether the tumor is growing and how quickly. If the scans show the tumor is growing or if the tumor causes progressive symptoms or other difficulties, you may need to undergo treatment.\nYou may need surgery to remove an acoustic neuroma, especially if the tumor is:\n\nContinuing to grow\nVery large\nCausing symptoms\n\nContinuing to grow\nVery large\nCausing symptoms\nYour surgeon may use one of several techniques for removing an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size of your tumor, hearing status and other factors.\nThe goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and preserve the facial nerve to prevent facial paralysis. Removing the entire tumor may not be possible in certain cases — for example, if the tumor is too close to important parts of the brain or the facial nerve.\nSurgery for an acoustic neuroma is performed under general anesthesia and involves removing the tumor through the inner ear or through a window in your skull.\nSometimes, surgical removal of the tumor may worsen symptoms if the hearing, balance, or facial nerves are irritated or damaged during the operation. Hearing may be lost on the side where the surgery is performed, and balance is usually affected temporarily.\nComplications may include:\n\nLeaking cerebrospinal fluid through the wound or nose\nHearing loss\nFacial weakness or numbness\nRinging in the ear\nBalance problems\nPersistent headache\nRarely, infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis)\nVery rarely, stroke or brain bleeding\n\nLeaking cerebrospinal fluid through the wound or nose\nHearing loss\nFacial weakness or numbness\nRinging in the ear\nBalance problems\nPersistent headache\nRarely, infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis)\nVery rarely, stroke or brain bleeding\nThere are several types of radiation therapy used to treat acoustic neuroma:\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery. Your doctor may recommend a type of radiation therapy known as stereotactic radiosurgery. It's often used if your tumor is small (less than 2.5 centimeters in diameter), you are an older adult or you cannot tolerate surgery for health reasons.\nStereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery, uses many tiny gamma rays to deliver a precisely targeted dose of radiation to a tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue or making an incision.\nThe goal of stereotactic radiosurgery is to stop the growth of a tumor, preserve the facial nerve's function and possibly preserve hearing.\nIt may take weeks, months or years before you notice the effects of radiosurgery. Your doctor will monitor your progress with follow-up imaging studies and hearing tests.\nRisks of radiosurgery include:\n\nHearing loss\nRinging in the ear\nFacial weakness or numbness\nBalance problems\nContinued tumor growth\n\n\nStereotactic radiotherapy. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) delivers a small dose of radiation to the tumor over several sessions. SRT is done to curb the growth of the tumor without damaging surrounding brain tissue.\nProton beam therapy.

If the scans show the tumor is growing or if the tumor causes progressive symptoms or other difficulties, you may need to undergo treatment.\nYou may need surgery to remove an acoustic neuroma, especially if the tumor is:\n\nContinuing to grow\nVery large\nCausing symptoms\n\nContinuing to grow\nVery large\nCausing symptoms\nYour surgeon may use one of several techniques for removing an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size of your tumor, hearing status and other factors.\nThe goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and preserve the facial nerve to prevent facial paralysis. Removing the entire tumor may not be possible in certain cases — for example, if the tumor is too close to important parts of the brain or the facial nerve.\nSurgery for an acoustic neuroma is performed under general anesthesia and involves removing the tumor through the inner ear or through a window in your skull.\nSometimes, surgical removal of the tumor may worsen symptoms if the hearing, balance, or facial nerves are irritated or damaged during the operation. Hearing may be lost on the side where the surgery is performed, and balance is usually affected temporarily.\nComplications may include:\n\nLeaking cerebrospinal fluid through the wound or nose\nHearing loss\nFacial weakness or numbness\nRinging in the ear\nBalance problems\nPersistent headache\nRarely, infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis)\nVery rarely, stroke or brain bleeding\n\nLeaking cerebrospinal fluid through the wound or nose\nHearing loss\nFacial weakness or numbness\nRinging in the ear\nBalance problems\nPersistent headache\nRarely, infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis)\nVery rarely, stroke or brain bleeding\nThere are several types of radiation therapy used to treat acoustic neuroma:\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery. Your doctor may recommend a type of radiation therapy known as stereotactic radiosurgery. It's often used if your tumor is small (less than 2.5 centimeters in diameter), you are an older adult or you cannot tolerate surgery for health reasons.\nStereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma Knife radiosurgery, uses many tiny gamma rays to deliver a precisely targeted dose of radiation to a tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue or making an incision.\nThe goal of stereotactic radiosurgery is to stop the growth of a tumor, preserve the facial nerve's function and possibly preserve hearing.\nIt may take weeks, months or years before you notice the effects of radiosurgery. Your doctor will monitor your progress with follow-up imaging studies and hearing tests.\nRisks of radiosurgery include:\n\nHearing loss\nRinging in the ear\nFacial weakness or numbness\nBalance problems\nContinued tumor growth\n\n\nStereotactic radiotherapy. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) delivers a small dose of radiation to the tumor over several sessions. SRT is done to curb the growth of the tumor without damaging surrounding brain tissue.\nProton beam therapy. This type of radiation therapy uses high-energy beams of positively charged particles called protons. Protons are delivered to the affected area in targeted doses to treat tumors and minimize radiation exposure to the surrounding area.\n\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery.

Here are some suggestions you may find helpful:\n\nEducate yourself about acoustic neuroma. The more you know, the better prepared you'll be to make good choices about treatment. Besides talking to your doctor and your audiologist, you may want to talk to a counselor or social worker. Or you may find it helpful to talk to other people who've had an acoustic neuroma and learn more about their experiences during and after treatment.\n\nMaintain a strong support system. Family and friends can help you as you go through this difficult time. Sometimes, though, you may find the concern and understanding of other people with acoustic neuroma especially comforting.\nYour doctor or a social worker may be able to put you in touch with a support group. Or you may find an in-person or online support group through the Acoustic Neuroma Association.\n\n\nEducate yourself about acoustic neuroma.

What websites do you recommend visiting?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment.\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:\n\nWhen did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are your symptoms?\nDo you have any family members with an acoustic neuroma?\nAt its current level, do you feel the hearing in the affected ear is useful to you in any way? For example, can you use that ear on the telephone, or does that ear help you tell where sound is coming from?\nDo you have regular headaches currently or have you had them in the past?\n\nWhen did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are your symptoms?\nDo you have any family members with an acoustic neuroma?\nAt its current level, do you feel the hearing in the affected ear is useful to you in any way?

It's important to talk to your health care provider about your other health conditions and the medications you're taking.\nHIV\nHIV\nIf you are started on medications by another health care provider, it's important to let the provider know about your HIV therapy. This will allow the provider to make sure there are no interactions between the medications.\nHIV\nYour health care provider will monitor your viral load and CD4 T cell counts to determine your response to HIV treatment. These will be initially checked at 4 to 6 weeks, and then every 3 to 6 months.\nHIV\nTreatment should lower your viral load so that it's undetectable in the blood. That doesn't mean your HIV is gone. Even if it can't be found in the blood, HIV is still present in other places in your body, such as in lymph nodes and internal organs.\nHIV\nHIV\nAlong with receiving medical treatment, it's essential to take an active role in your own care. The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

Even if it can't be found in the blood, HIV is still present in other places in your body, such as in lymph nodes and internal organs.\nHIV\nHIV\nAlong with receiving medical treatment, it's essential to take an active role in your own care. The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

This will allow the provider to make sure there are no interactions between the medications.\nHIV\nYour health care provider will monitor your viral load and CD4 T cell counts to determine your response to HIV treatment. These will be initially checked at 4 to 6 weeks, and then every 3 to 6 months.\nHIV\nTreatment should lower your viral load so that it's undetectable in the blood. That doesn't mean your HIV is gone. Even if it can't be found in the blood, HIV is still present in other places in your body, such as in lymph nodes and internal organs.\nHIV\nHIV\nAlong with receiving medical treatment, it's essential to take an active role in your own care. The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

CD4 T cells are white blood cells that are specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Even if you have no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when your CD4 T cell count dips below 200.\nViral load (HIV RNA). This test measures the amount of virus in your blood. After starting HIV treatment, the goal is to have an undetectable viral load. This significantly reduces your chances of opportunistic infection and other HIV-related complications.\nDrug resistance. Some strains of HIV are resistant to medications.

CD4 T cells are white blood cells that are specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Even if you have no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when your CD4 T cell count dips below 200.\nViral load (HIV RNA). This test measures the amount of virus in your blood. After starting HIV treatment, the goal is to have an undetectable viral load. This significantly reduces your chances of opportunistic infection and other HIV-related complications.\nDrug resistance. Some strains of HIV are resistant to medications.

Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. However, there are many medications that can control HIV and prevent complications. These medications are called antiretroviral therapy (ART). Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be started on ART, regardless of their stage of infection or complications.\nHIV\nAIDS\nHIV\nHIV\nART\nART is usually a combination of two or more medications from several different drug classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount of HIV in the blood. There are many ART options that combine multiple HIV medications into one pill, taken once daily.\nART\nHIV\nART\nHIV\nEach class of drugs blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves combinations of drugs from different classes to:\n\nAccount for individual drug resistance (viral genotype)\nAvoid creating new drug-resistant strains of HIV\nMaximize suppression of virus in the blood\n\nAccount for individual drug resistance (viral genotype)\nAvoid creating new drug-resistant strains of HIV\nHIV\nMaximize suppression of virus in the blood\nTwo drugs from one class, plus a third drug from a second class, are typically used.\nThe classes of anti-HIV drugs include:\nHIV\n\n\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself.\nExamples include efavirenz (Sustiva), rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).\n\n\nNucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are faulty versions of the building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself.\nExamples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir).\nCombination drugs also are available, such as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy).\n\n\nProtease inhibitors (PIs) inactivate HIV protease, another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself.\nExamples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra).\n\n\nIntegrase inhibitors work by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells.\nExamples include bictegravir sodium/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).\n\n\nEntry or fusion inhibitors block HIV's entry into CD4

with an undetectable HIV viral load in the blood is the best way for you to stay healthy.\nART\nHIV\nFor ART to be effective, it's important that you take the medications as prescribed, without missing or skipping any doses.

Let your provider know right away if you're having problems with HIV therapy so that you can work together to find ways to address those challenges.\nHIV\nTreatment side effects can include:\n\nNausea, vomiting or diarrhea\nHeart disease\nKidney and liver damage\nWeakened bones or bone loss\nAbnormal cholesterol levels\nHigher blood sugar\nCognitive and emotional problems, as well as sleep problems\n\nNausea, vomiting or diarrhea\nHeart disease\nKidney and liver damage\nWeakened bones or bone loss\nAbnormal cholesterol levels\nHigher blood sugar\nCognitive and emotional problems, as well as sleep problems\nSome health issues that are a natural part of aging may be more difficult to manage if you have HIV. Some medications that are common for age-related heart, bone or metabolic conditions, for example, may not interact well with anti-HIV medications. It's important to talk to your health care provider about your other health conditions and the medications you're taking.\nHIV\nHIV\nIf you are started on medications by another health care provider, it's important to let the provider know about your HIV therapy. This will allow the provider to make sure there are no interactions between the medications.\nHIV\nYour health care provider will monitor your viral load and CD4 T cell counts to determine your response to HIV treatment. These will be initially checked at 4 to 6 weeks, and then every 3 to 6 months.\nHIV\nTreatment should lower your viral load so that it's undetectable in the blood. That doesn't mean your HIV is gone. Even if it can't be found in the blood, HIV is still present in other places in your body, such as in lymph nodes and internal organs.\nHIV\nHIV\nAlong with receiving medical treatment, it's essential to take an active role in your own care. The following suggestions may help you stay healthy longer:\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein help keep you strong, give you more energy and support your immune system.\nAvoid raw meat, eggs and more. Foodborne illnesses can be especially severe in people who are infected with HIV. Cook meat until it's well done. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products, raw eggs and raw seafood such as oysters, sushi or sashimi.\nGet the right vaccinations. These may prevent typical infections such as pneumonia and influenza. Your health care provider may also recommend other vaccinations, including for HPV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Inactivated vaccines are generally safe, but most vaccines with live viruses are not, due to your weakened immune system.\nTake care with companion animals. Some animals may carry parasites that can cause infections in people who are HIV-positive. Cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis, reptiles can carry salmonella, and birds can carry cryptococcus or histoplasmosis. Wash hands thoroughly after handling pets or emptying the litter box.\n\nEat healthy foods. Make sure you get enough nourishment.

However, there is no scientific evidence that any nutritional supplement improves immunity, and many may interfere with other medications you're taking. Always check with your health care provider before taking any supplements or alternative therapies to ensure there are no medication interactions.\nHIV\nHIV\nThere's little evidence on the effectiveness and benefits of supplements for HIV. Some examples with limited research include:\nHIV\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine. Researchers have used acetyl-L-carnitine to treat nerve pain, numbness or weakness (neuropathy) in people with diabetes. It may also ease neuropathy linked to HIV if you're lacking in the substance.\nWhey protein and certain amino acids. Early evidence suggests that whey protein, a cheese byproduct, can help some people with HIV gain weight. The amino acids L-glutamine, L-arginine and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) may also help with weight gain.\nProbiotics. There is some evidence that the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii may help with HIV-related diarrhea, but use only as directed by your health care provider. Bovine colostrum is also being studied for treating diarrhea. But more research is needed.\nVitamins and minerals. Vitamins A, D, E, C and B — as well as the minerals zinc, iron and selenium — may be helpful if you have low levels of them. Talk to your health care provider first, as too much of some vitamins and minerals can be harmful.\n\nAcetyl-L-carnitine.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Your doctor will ask about your medical history and conduct a physical exam. Then he or she may recommend the following steps:\n\nIGF-1 measurement. After you've fasted overnight, your doctor will take a blood sample to measure the IGF-1 level in your blood. An elevated IGF-1 level suggests acromegaly.\nGrowth hormone suppression test. This is the best method for confirming an acromegaly diagnosis. During this test, your GH blood level is measured both before and after you drink a preparation of sugar (glucose). In people who don't have acromegaly, the glucose drink typically causes the GH level to fall. But if you have acromegaly, your GH level will tend to stay high.\nImaging. Your doctor may recommend an imaging test, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help pinpoint the location and size of a tumor on your pituitary gland. If no pituitary tumors are seen, your doctor may order other imaging tests to look for nonpituitary tumors.\n\nIGF-1 measurement.

Your treatment plan will likely depend on the location and size of your tumor, the severity of your symptoms, and your age and overall health.\nTo help lower your GH and IGF-1 levels, treatment options typically include surgery or radiation to remove or reduce the size of the tumor that is causing your symptoms, and medication to help normalize your hormone levels.\nIf you're experiencing health problems as a result of acromegaly, your doctor may recommend additional treatments to help manage your complications.\nDoctors can remove most pituitary tumors using a method called transsphenoidal surgery. During this procedure, your surgeon works through your nose to remove the tumor from your pituitary gland. If the tumor causing your symptoms isn't located on your pituitary gland, your doctor will recommend another type of surgery to remove the tumor.\nIn many cases — especially if your tumor is small — removal of the tumor returns your GH levels to normal. If the tumor was putting pressure on the tissues around your pituitary gland, removing the tumor also helps relieve headaches and vision changes.\nIn some cases, your surgeon may not be able to remove the entire tumor. If this is the case, you may still have elevated GH levels after surgery. Your doctor may recommend another surgery, medications or radiation treatments.\nYour doctor may recommend one of the following medications — or a combination of medications — to help your hormone levels return to normal:\n\nDrugs that reduce growth hormone production (somatostatin analogues). In the body, a brain hormone called somatostatin works against (inhibits) GH production. The drugs octreotide (Sandostatin) and lanreotide (Somatuline Depot) are man-made (synthetic) versions of somatostatin. Taking one of these drugs signals the pituitary gland to produce less GH, and may even reduce the size of a pituitary tumor. Typically, these drugs are injected into the muscles of your buttocks (gluteal muscles) once a month by a health care professional.\nDrugs to lower hormone levels (dopamine agonists). The oral medications cabergoline and bromocriptine (Parlodel) may help lower levels of GH and IGF-1 in some people. These drugs may also help decrease tumor size. To treat acromegaly, these medications usually need to be taken at high doses, which can increase the risk of side effects. Common side effects of these drugs include nausea, vomiting, stuffy nose, tiredness, dizziness, sleep problems and mood changes.\nDrug to block the action of GH (growth hormone antagonist). The medication pegvisomant (Somavert) blocks the effect of GH on the body's tissues. Pegvisomant may be particularly helpful for people who haven't had good success with other treatments. Given as a daily injection, this medication can help lower IGF-1 levels and relieve symptoms, but it doesn't lower GH levels or reduce tumor size.\n\nDrugs that reduce growth hormone production (somatostatin analogues).

Radiation therapy destroys any lingering tumor cells and slowly reduces GH levels. It may take years for this treatment to noticeably improve acromegaly symptoms.\nRadiation treatment often lowers levels of other pituitary hormones, too — not just GH. If you receive radiation treatment, you'll likely need regular follow-up visits with your doctor to make sure that your pituitary gland is working properly, and to check your hormone levels. This follow-up care may last for the rest of your life.\nTypes of radiation therapy include:\n\nConventional radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy is usually given every weekday over a period of four to six weeks. You may not see the full effect of conventional radiation therapy for 10 or more years after treatment.\nStereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses 3D imaging to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor cells, while limiting the amount of radiation to normal surrounding tissues. It can usually be delivered in a single dose. This type of radiation may bring GH levels back to normal within five to 10 years.\n\nConventional radiation therapy.

Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and to know what to expect from your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do to prepare for diagnostic tests.\nWrite down the symptoms you're experiencing. Keep track of anything causing you discomfort or concern, such as headaches, vision changes or discomfort in your hands, even if those things seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\nWrite down key personal information, including any changes in your sex life or, for women, in your menstrual cycle.\nMake a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements you're taking.\nTake along old photographs that your doctor can use to compare against your appearance today.

                "Diagnosis": "If you have signs or symptoms associated with acute coronary syndrome, an emergency room doctor will likely order several tests. Some tests may be done while your doctor is asking you questions about your symptoms or medical history. Tests include:\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). Electrodes attached to your skin measure the electrical activity in your heart. Abnormal or irregular impulses can mean your heart is not working properly due to a lack of oxygen. Certain patterns in electrical signals may show the general location of a blockage. The test may be repeated several times.\nBlood tests. Certain enzymes may be detected in the blood if cell death has resulted in damage to heart tissue. A positive result indicates a heart attack.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). Electrodes attached to your skin measure the electrical activity in your heart. Abnormal or irregular impulses can mean your heart is not working properly due to a lack of oxygen. Certain patterns in electrical signals may show the general location of a blockage. The test may be repeated several times.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG).\nBlood tests. Certain enzymes may be detected in the blood if cell death has resulted in damage to heart tissue. A positive result indicates a heart attack.\nBlood tests.\n\nThe information from these two tests — as well as your signs and symptoms — is used to make a primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Your doctor can use the information to determine whether your condition can be classified as a heart attack or unstable angina.\nOther tests may be done to learn more about your condition, rule out other causes of symptoms, or to help your doctor personalize your diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCoronary angiogram. This procedure uses X-ray imaging to see your heart's blood vessels. A long, tiny tube (catheter) is threaded through an artery, usually in your arm or groin, to the arteries in your heart. A dye flows through the tube into your arteries. A series of X-rays show how the dye moves through your arteries, revealing any blockages or narrowing. The catheter may also be used for treatments.\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves, directed at your heart from a wand-like device, to produce a live image of your heart. An echocardiogram can help determine whether the heart is pumping correctly.\nMyocardial perfusion imaging. This test shows how well blood flows through your heart muscle. A tiny, safe amount of radioactive substance is injected into your blood. A specialized camera takes images of the substance's path through your heart. They show your doctor whether enough blood is flowing through heart muscles and where blood flow is reduced.\nComputerized tomography (CT) angiogram. A CT angiogram uses a specialized X-ray technology that can produce multiple images — cross-sectional 2-D slices — of your heart. These images can detect narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\nStress test. A stress test reveals how well your heart works when you exercise. In some cases, you may receive a medication to increase your heart rate rather than exercising. This test is done only when there are no signs of acute coronary syndrome or another life-threatening heart condition when you are at rest. During the stress test, an ECG, echocardiogram or myocardial perfusion imaging may be used to see how well your heart works.\n\nCoronary angiogram.

This procedure uses X-ray imaging to see your heart's blood vessels. A long, tiny tube (catheter) is threaded through an artery, usually in your arm or groin, to the arteries in your heart. A dye flows through the tube into your arteries. A series of X-rays show how the dye moves through your arteries, revealing any blockages or narrowing.

An echocardiogram can help determine whether the heart is pumping correctly.\nMyocardial perfusion imaging. This test shows how well blood flows through your heart muscle. A tiny, safe amount of radioactive substance is injected into your blood. A specialized camera takes images of the substance's path through your heart. They show your doctor whether enough blood is flowing through heart muscles and where blood flow is reduced.\nComputerized tomography (CT) angiogram. A CT angiogram uses a specialized X-ray technology that can produce multiple images — cross-sectional 2-D slices — of your heart. These images can detect narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\nStress test. A stress test reveals how well your heart works when you exercise. In some cases, you may receive a medication to increase your heart rate rather than exercising. This test is done only when there are no signs of acute coronary syndrome or another life-threatening heart condition when you are at rest. During the stress test, an ECG, echocardiogram or myocardial perfusion imaging may be used to see how well your heart works.\n\nCoronary angiogram.

Your doctor can use the information to determine whether your condition can be classified as a heart attack or unstable angina.\nOther tests may be done to learn more about your condition, rule out other causes of symptoms, or to help your doctor personalize your diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCoronary angiogram. This procedure uses X-ray imaging to see your heart's blood vessels. A long, tiny tube (catheter) is threaded through an artery, usually in your arm or groin, to the arteries in your heart. A dye flows through the tube into your arteries. A series of X-rays show how the dye moves through your arteries, revealing any blockages or narrowing. The catheter may also be used for treatments.\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves, directed at your heart from a wand-like device, to produce a live image of your heart. An echocardiogram can help determine whether the heart is pumping correctly.\nMyocardial perfusion imaging. This test shows how well blood flows through your heart muscle. A tiny, safe amount of radioactive substance is injected into your blood. A specialized camera takes images of the substance's path through your heart. They show your doctor whether enough blood is flowing through heart muscles and where blood flow is reduced.\nComputerized tomography (CT) angiogram. A CT angiogram uses a specialized X-ray technology that can produce multiple images — cross-sectional 2-D slices — of your heart. These images can detect narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.\nStress test. A stress test reveals how well your heart works when you exercise. In some cases, you may receive a medication to increase your heart rate rather than exercising. This test is done only when there are no signs of acute coronary syndrome or another life-threatening heart condition when you are at rest. During the stress test, an ECG, echocardiogram or myocardial perfusion imaging may be used to see how well your heart works.\n\nCoronary angiogram.

A combination of drugs and surgical procedures may be used to meet these goals.\nDepending on your diagnosis, medications for emergency or ongoing care (or both) may include the following:\n\nThrombolytics (clot busters) help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking an artery.\nNitroglycerin improves blood flow by temporarily widening blood vessels.\nAntiplatelet drugs help prevent blood clots from forming and include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) and others.\nBeta blockers help relax your heart muscle and slow your heart rate. They decrease the demand on your heart and lower blood pressure. Examples include metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL) and nadolol (Corgard).\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors widen blood vessels and improve blood flow, allowing the heart to work better. They include lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin) and others.\nAngiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) help control blood pressure and include irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and several others.\nStatins lower the amount of cholesterol moving in the blood and may stabilize plaque deposits, making them less likely to rupture. Statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor, Flolipid) and several others.\n\nThrombolytics (clot busters) help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking an artery.\nThrombolytics\nNitroglycerin improves blood flow by temporarily widening blood vessels.\nNitroglycerin\nAntiplatelet drugs help prevent blood clots from forming and include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) and others.\nAntiplatelet drugs\nBeta blockers help relax your heart muscle and slow your heart rate.

In this procedure, your doctor inserts a long, tiny tube (catheter) into the blocked or narrowed part of your artery. A wire with a deflated balloon is passed through the catheter to the narrowed area. The balloon is then inflated, opening the artery by compressing the plaque deposits against your artery walls. A mesh tube (stent) is usually left in the artery to help keep the artery open.\nCoronary bypass surgery. With this procedure, a surgeon takes a piece of blood vessel (graft) from another part of your body and creates a new route for blood that goes around (bypasses) a blocked coronary artery.\n\nAngioplasty and stenting.

The doctor might recommend:\n\nExamining the nervous system. The doctor examines the places on the body where you or your child has weakness, poor muscle tone and decreased reflexes.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This imaging test allows the doctor to look at the brain and spinal cord.\nLab tests. The doctor might take samples of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid), respiratory fluid, blood, and stool for lab testing.\nA nerve check. This test can check how fast an electrical impulse moves through the nerves and the response of muscles to messages from the nerves.\n\nExamining the nervous system.

These tests can help distinguish acute flaccid myelitis from other conditions.\nCurrently, there is no specific treatment for acute flaccid myelitis. Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms.\nA doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) might recommend physical or occupational therapy to help with arm or leg weakness. If physical therapy is started during the initial phase of the illness, it might improve long-term recovery.\nThe doctor might also recommend treatment with immunoglobulin that contains healthy antibodies from healthy donors, drugs that lower inflammation in the body (corticosteroids) or antiviral drugs. Or the doctor might recommend a treatment that removes and replaces blood plasma (plasma exchange). However, it's not clear whether these treatments have any benefits.\nSometimes nerve and muscle transfer surgeries are done to improve limb function.\nIf you have symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis, seek immediate medical care.\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\nMake a list of the following:\n\nSigns and symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for the appointment\nAny medications, including vitamins, herbs and over-the-counter medicines that you or your child is taking, and their dosages\nKey personal information, including recent illnesses, travel and activities\nQuestions to ask the doctor\n\nSigns and symptoms, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for the appointment\nSigns and symptoms,\nAny medications, including vitamins, herbs and over-the-counter medicines that you or your child is taking, and their dosages\nAny medications, including vitamins, herbs and over-the-counter medicines\nKey personal information, including recent illnesses, travel and activities\nKey personal information\nQuestions to ask the doctor\nQuestions to ask\nFor acute flaccid myelitis, some basic questions to ask the doctor include:\n\nWill additional tests be needed?\nWhat are the treatment options?\nWhat are the benefits and risks of each treatment?\nIs there one treatment you feel is best?\nShould additional specialists be seen?

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials.

By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "If you have signs or symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia, your doctor may recommend that you undergo diagnostic tests, including:\n\nBlood tests. Most people with acute myelogenous leukemia have too many white blood cells, not enough red blood cells and not enough platelets. But sometimes the level of white blood cells can be too low. The presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in bone marrow but not circulating in the blood — is another indicator of acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nBone marrow test. A blood test can suggest leukemia, but it usually takes a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis.\nDuring a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of your bone marrow. Usually, the sample is taken from your hipbone. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap). In certain situations, it may be necessary to remove some of the fluid around your spinal cord to check for leukemia cells. Your doctor can collect this fluid by inserting a small needle into the spinal canal in your lower back.\nTesting your cancer cells in the laboratory. In a laboratory, doctors test your leukemia cells to better understand which gene mutations are present. This can help determine your prognosis and guide your treatment.\n\nBlood tests.

Most people with acute myelogenous leukemia have too many white blood cells, not enough red blood cells and not enough platelets. But sometimes the level of white blood cells can be too low. The presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in bone marrow but not circulating in the blood — is another indicator of acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nBone marrow test.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

In other cases, acute kidney failure may cause you to have too much fluid, leading to swelling in your arms and legs. In these cases, your doctor may recommend medications (diuretics) to cause your body to expel extra fluids.\nTreatments to balance the amount of fluids in your blood.\nMedications to control blood potassium. If your kidneys aren't properly filtering potassium from your blood, your doctor may prescribe calcium, glucose or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kionex) to prevent the accumulation of high levels of potassium in your blood. Too much potassium in the blood can cause dangerous irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and muscle weakness.\nMedications to control blood potassium.\nMedications to restore blood calcium levels. If the levels of calcium in your blood drop too low, your doctor may recommend an infusion of calcium.\nMedications to restore blood calcium levels.\nDialysis to remove toxins from your blood. If toxins build up in your blood, you may need temporary hemodialysis — often referred to simply as dialysis — to help remove toxins and excess fluids from your body while your kidneys heal. Dialysis may also help remove excess potassium from your body. During dialysis, a machine pumps blood out of your body through an artificial kidney (dialyzer) that filters out waste. The blood is then returned to your body.\nDialysis to remove toxins from your blood.\nDuring your recovery from acute kidney failure, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys.\nDepending on your situation, your dietitian may recommend that you:\n\nChoose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cauliflower, peppers, grapes and strawberries.\nAvoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses.\nLimit phosphorus. Phosphorus is a mineral found in foods, such as whole-grain bread, oatmeal, bran cereals, dark-colored colas, nuts and peanut butter. Too much phosphorus in your blood can weaken your bones and cause skin itchiness.

Medications can help reduce the fluid buildup in your brain.\nLiver transplant. When acute liver failure can't be reversed, the only treatment may be a liver transplant. During a liver transplant, a surgeon removes your damaged liver and replaces it with a healthy liver from a donor.\nScreening for infections. Your medical team will take samples of your blood and urine every now and then to be tested for infection. If your doctor suspects that you have an infection, you'll receive medications to treat the infection.\nPreventing severe bleeding. Your doctor can give you medications to reduce the risk of bleeding. If you lose a lot of blood, your doctor may perform tests to find the source of the blood loss.

A machine would do the job of the liver, much like dialysis helps when the kidneys stop working. There are many different types of devices being studied. Research suggests that some, but not all, devices may improve survival. A well-controlled multicenter trial showed that one system, called an extracorporeal liver support system, helped some people with acute liver failure survive without a transplant. The treatment is also called high-volume plasma exchange. However, more study is needed for this therapy.\nHepatocyte transplantation. Transplanting only the cells of the liver — not the entire organ — may temporarily delay the need for a liver transplant. In some cases, it could lead to a complete recovery. A shortage of good-quality donor livers has limited the use of this treatment.\nAuxiliary liver transplantation. This procedure involves removing a small piece of your liver and replacing it with a similarly sized graft. This allows your own liver to regenerate without the need for immunosuppressant drugs. At this time, auxiliary liver transplantation is a difficult procedure that needs more time to be evaluated.\nXenotransplantation. This type of transplant replaces the human liver with one from an animal or other nonhuman source. Doctors performed experimental liver transplants using pig livers several decades ago, but results were disappointing. However, advancements in immune and transplant medicine have prompted researchers to consider this treatment again.

Transplanting only the cells of the liver — not the entire organ — may temporarily delay the need for a liver transplant. In some cases, it could lead to a complete recovery. A shortage of good-quality donor livers has limited the use of this treatment.\nAuxiliary liver transplantation. This procedure involves removing a small piece of your liver and replacing it with a similarly sized graft. This allows your own liver to regenerate without the need for immunosuppressant drugs.

This type of transplant replaces the human liver with one from an animal or other nonhuman source. Doctors performed experimental liver transplants using pig livers several decades ago, but results were disappointing.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow.

During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\nDoctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.

                "Preparing for your appointment": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:\n\nBlood tests. Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.\n\nBone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\nDoctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.\n\nImaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.\nSpinal fluid test. A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.\n\nBlood tests.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow.

                "What to expect from the doctor": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:\n\nBlood tests. Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.\n\nBone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\nDoctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.\n\nImaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.\nSpinal fluid test. A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments.

If your doctor suspects acute lymphocytic leukemia, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating diseases and conditions of the blood and bone marrow (hematologist).\nBecause appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from the doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\nWrite down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.\nMake a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements that you're taking.\nConsider taking a family member or friend along.

List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For acute lymphocytic leukemia, some basic questions to ask the doctor include:\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?\nAre there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?\nWhat will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist?

Being ready to answer them may allow time to cover other points you want to address. Your doctor may ask:\n\nWhen did symptoms begin?\nHave these symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen these symptoms?\n\nWhen did symptoms begin?\nHave these symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen these symptoms?\nAvoid activity that seems to worsen any signs and symptoms. For instance, if you or your child is feeling fatigued, allow for more rest. Determine which of the day's activities are most important, and focus on accomplishing those tasks.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n",

The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.\nSpinal fluid test.\nYour doctor uses information gathered from these tests and procedures to determine your prognosis and decide on your treatment options. Other types of cancer use numerical stages to indicate how far the cancer has spread, but there are no stages of acute lymphocytic leukemia.\nInstead, the seriousness of your condition is determined by:\n\nThe type of lymphocytes involved — B cells or T cells\nThe specific genetic changes present in your leukemia cells\nYour age\nResults from lab tests, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample\n\nThe type of lymphocytes involved — B cells or T cells\nThe specific genetic changes present in your leukemia cells\nYour age\nResults from lab tests, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample\nIn general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:\n\nInduction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.\n\nChemotherapy.

Based on your overall health and your goals and preferences, you may decide to undergo treatment for your leukemia.\nSome people may choose to forgo treatment for the cancer, instead focusing on treatments that improve their symptoms and help them make the most of the time they have remaining.\nNo alternative treatments have been proved to cure acute lymphocytic leukemia. But some alternative therapies may help ease the side effects of cancer treatment and make you or your child more comfortable. Discuss your options with your doctor, as some alternative treatments could interfere with cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy.\nAlternative treatments that may ease symptoms include:\n\nAcupuncture\nExercise\nMassage\nMeditation\nRelaxation activities, including yoga and tai chi\n\nAcupuncture\nExercise\nMassage\nMeditation\nRelaxation activities, including yoga and tai chi\nTreatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can be a long road.

                "Coping and support": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:\n\nBlood tests. Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.\n\nBone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\nDoctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.\n\nImaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.\nSpinal fluid test. A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments.

A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.\nSpinal fluid test.\nYour doctor uses information gathered from these tests and procedures to determine your prognosis and decide on your treatment options. Other types of cancer use numerical stages to indicate how far the cancer has spread, but there are no stages of acute lymphocytic leukemia.\nInstead, the seriousness of your condition is determined by:\n\nThe type of lymphocytes involved — B cells or T cells\nThe specific genetic changes present in your leukemia cells\nYour age\nResults from lab tests, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample\n\nThe type of lymphocytes involved — B cells or T cells\nThe specific genetic changes present in your leukemia cells\nYour age\nResults from lab tests, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample\nIn general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:\n\nInduction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain.

List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For acute lymphocytic leukemia, some basic questions to ask the doctor include:\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?\nAre there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?\nWhat will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist?

For acute lymphocytic leukemia, some basic questions to ask the doctor include:\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?\nAre there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?\nWhat will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist?

What websites do you recommend?\nWhat will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask other questions.\nThe doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may allow time to cover other points you want to address. Your doctor may ask:\n\nWhen did symptoms begin?\nHave these symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen these symptoms?\n\nWhen did symptoms begin?\nHave these symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen these symptoms?\nAvoid activity that seems to worsen any signs and symptoms. For instance, if you or your child is feeling fatigued, allow for more rest. Determine which of the day's activities are most important, and focus on accomplishing those tasks.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system.

Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments.

Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from the doctor.\n",
                "What you can do": "Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:\n\nBlood tests. Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.\n\nBone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\nDoctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.\n\nImaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.\nSpinal fluid test. A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.\n\nBlood tests.

Other types of cancer use numerical stages to indicate how far the cancer has spread, but there are no stages of acute lymphocytic leukemia.\nInstead, the seriousness of your condition is determined by:\n\nThe type of lymphocytes involved — B cells or T cells\nThe specific genetic changes present in your leukemia cells\nYour age\nResults from lab tests, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample\n\nThe type of lymphocytes involved — B cells or T cells\nThe specific genetic changes present in your leukemia cells\nYour age\nResults from lab tests, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample\nIn general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:\n\nInduction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n\nInduction therapy.

Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\nMaintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\nPreventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system.

By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n\n\nEngineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments.

A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\nCAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n\nClinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.\n\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\nChemotherapy.\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\nTargeted therapy.\nRadiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\nRadiation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs.

Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.\nClinical trials.\nOlder adults, such as those older than 65, tend to experience more complications from treatments. And older adults generally have a worse prognosis than children who are treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia.\nDiscuss your options with your doctor. Based on your overall health and your goals and preferences, you may decide to undergo treatment for your leukemia.\nSome people may choose to forgo treatment for the cancer, instead focusing on treatments that improve their symptoms and help them make the most of the time they have remaining.\nNo alternative treatments have been proved to cure acute lymphocytic leukemia. But some alternative therapies may help ease the side effects of cancer treatment and make you or your child more comfortable. Discuss your options with your doctor, as some alternative treatments could interfere with cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy.\nAlternative treatments that may ease symptoms include:\n\nAcupuncture\nExercise\nMassage\nMeditation\nRelaxation activities, including yoga and tai chi\n\nAcupuncture\nExercise\nMassage\nMeditation\nRelaxation activities, including yoga and tai chi\nTreatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can be a long road.

And adults may be able to continue working. To help you cope, try to:\n\n\nLearn enough about leukemia to feel comfortable making treatment decisions. Ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nWrite down questions you want to ask your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nLean on your whole health care team. At major medical centers and pediatric cancer centers, your health care team may include psychologists, psychiatrists, recreation therapists, child-life workers, teachers, dietitians, chaplains and social workers. These professionals can help with a whole host of issues, including explaining procedures to children, finding financial assistance and arranging for housing during treatment. Don't hesitate to rely on their expertise.\nExplore programs for children with cancer. Major medical centers and nonprofit groups offer numerous activities and services specifically for children with cancer and their families. Examples include summer camps, support groups for siblings and wish-granting programs. Ask your health care team about programs in your area.\nHelp family and friends understand your situation. Set up a free, personalized webpage at the nonprofit website CaringBridge. This allows you to tell the whole family about appointments, treatments, setbacks and reasons to celebrate — without the stress of calling everyone every time there's something new to report.\n\n\nLearn enough about leukemia to feel comfortable making treatment decisions.

List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For acute lymphocytic leukemia, some basic questions to ask the doctor include:\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?\nAre there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?\nWhat will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?\n\nWhat is likely causing these symptoms?\nWhat are other possible causes for these symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests are necessary?\nIs this condition likely temporary or chronic?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nHow can other existing health conditions be best managed with ALL?\nAre there any restrictions that need to be followed?\nIs it necessary to see a specialist?

Being ready to answer them may allow time to cover other points you want to address. Your doctor may ask:\n\nWhen did symptoms begin?\nHave these symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen these symptoms?\n\nWhen did symptoms begin?\nHave these symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve these symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen these symptoms?\nAvoid activity that seems to worsen any signs and symptoms. For instance, if you or your child is feeling fatigued, allow for more rest. Determine which of the day's activities are most important, and focus on accomplishing those tasks.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\nConsolidation therapy.\nTherapies used in these phases include:\n\n\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

                "What you can do": "If you have signs or symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia, your doctor may recommend that you undergo diagnostic tests, including:\n\nBlood tests. Most people with acute myelogenous leukemia have too many white blood cells, not enough red blood cells and not enough platelets. But sometimes the level of white blood cells can be too low. The presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in bone marrow but not circulating in the blood — is another indicator of acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nBone marrow test. A blood test can suggest leukemia, but it usually takes a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis.\nDuring a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of your bone marrow. Usually, the sample is taken from your hipbone. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap). In certain situations, it may be necessary to remove some of the fluid around your spinal cord to check for leukemia cells. Your doctor can collect this fluid by inserting a small needle into the spinal canal in your lower back.\nTesting your cancer cells in the laboratory. In a laboratory, doctors test your leukemia cells to better understand which gene mutations are present. This can help determine your prognosis and guide your treatment.\n\nBlood tests.

Special laboratory testing also may be used to identify the specific characteristics of your cells.\nAML\nYour AML subtype helps determine which treatments may be best for you. Doctors are studying how different types of cancer treatment affect people with different AML subtypes.\nAML\nAML\nYour doctor uses your AML subtype and other information to determine your prognosis and decide on your treatment options.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials.

                "What you can do in the meantime": "If you have signs or symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia, your doctor may recommend that you undergo diagnostic tests, including:\n\nBlood tests. Most people with acute myelogenous leukemia have too many white blood cells, not enough red blood cells and not enough platelets. But sometimes the level of white blood cells can be too low. The presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in bone marrow but not circulating in the blood — is another indicator of acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nBone marrow test. A blood test can suggest leukemia, but it usually takes a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis.\nDuring a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of your bone marrow. Usually, the sample is taken from your hipbone. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap). In certain situations, it may be necessary to remove some of the fluid around your spinal cord to check for leukemia cells. Your doctor can collect this fluid by inserting a small needle into the spinal canal in your lower back.\nTesting your cancer cells in the laboratory. In a laboratory, doctors test your leukemia cells to better understand which gene mutations are present. This can help determine your prognosis and guide your treatment.\n\nBlood tests.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\nConsolidation therapy.\nTherapies used in these phases include:\n\n\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "If you have signs or symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia, your doctor may recommend that you undergo diagnostic tests, including:\n\nBlood tests. Most people with acute myelogenous leukemia have too many white blood cells, not enough red blood cells and not enough platelets. But sometimes the level of white blood cells can be too low. The presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in bone marrow but not circulating in the blood — is another indicator of acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nBone marrow test. A blood test can suggest leukemia, but it usually takes a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis.\nDuring a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of your bone marrow. Usually, the sample is taken from your hipbone. The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap). In certain situations, it may be necessary to remove some of the fluid around your spinal cord to check for leukemia cells. Your doctor can collect this fluid by inserting a small needle into the spinal canal in your lower back.\nTesting your cancer cells in the laboratory. In a laboratory, doctors test your leukemia cells to better understand which gene mutations are present. This can help determine your prognosis and guide your treatment.\n\nBlood tests.

Special laboratory testing also may be used to identify the specific characteristics of your cells.\nAML\nYour AML subtype helps determine which treatments may be best for you. Doctors are studying how different types of cancer treatment affect people with different AML subtypes.\nAML\nAML\nYour doctor uses your AML subtype and other information to determine your prognosis and decide on your treatment options.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nLearn enough to make decisions about your care.\nWrite down questions for your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\nLean on family and friends. It can be difficult to talk about your diagnosis, and you'll likely get a range of reactions when you share the news. But talking about your diagnosis can be helpful. So can the outpouring of practical help that often results.\nLean on family and friends.\nTake care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in the tests, treatments and procedures of therapy. But it's important to take care of yourself, not just the cancer. Try to make time for yoga, cooking or other favorite diversions.\nTake care of yourself.\nMake an appointment with your family doctor if you have signs and symptoms that worry you. If your doctor suspects you may have leukemia, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in blood cell diseases (hematologist).\nBecause appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready and know what to expect from your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.

Special laboratory testing also may be used to identify the specific characteristics of your cells.\nAML\nYour AML subtype helps determine which treatments may be best for you. Doctors are studying how different types of cancer treatment affect people with different AML subtypes.\nAML\nAML\nYour doctor uses your AML subtype and other information to determine your prognosis and decide on your treatment options. Other types of cancer use numerical stages to indicate your prognosis and whether your cancer has spread, but there are no stages of acute myelogenous leukemia.\nAML\nInstead, the seriousness of your condition is determined by:\n\nAML subtype\nYour age\nYour overall health\nResults from other tests and procedures, such as the number of white blood cells found in a blood sample\n\nAML subtype\nAML\nYour age\nYour overall health\nResults from other tests and procedures, such as the number of white blood cells found in a blood sample\nTreatment of acute myelogenous leukemia depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health and your preferences.\nIn general, treatment falls into two phases:\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\nConsolidation therapy.\nTherapies used in these phases include:\n\n\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nWrite down questions for your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nLean on family and friends. It can be difficult to talk about your diagnosis, and you'll likely get a range of reactions when you share the news. But talking about your diagnosis can be helpful.

The term \"leukemia\" can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that similar except for the fact that they affect the bone marrow and blood. You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nWrite down questions for your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nLean on family and friends. It can be difficult to talk about your diagnosis, and you'll likely get a range of reactions when you share the news. But talking about your diagnosis can be helpful. So can the outpouring of practical help that often results.\nTake care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in the tests, treatments and procedures of therapy.

By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\nTargeted therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nBone marrow transplant.

That leaves people with a new diagnosis faced with important decisions about a disease they may not yet understand. Here are some tips for coping:\n\n\nLearn enough to make decisions about your care. The term \"leukemia\" can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that similar except for the fact that they affect the bone marrow and blood. You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nWrite down questions for your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nLean on family and friends. It can be difficult to talk about your diagnosis, and you'll likely get a range of reactions when you share the news. But talking about your diagnosis can be helpful. So can the outpouring of practical help that often results.\nTake care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in the tests, treatments and procedures of therapy. But it's important to take care of yourself, not just the cancer. Try to make time for yoga, cooking or other favorite diversions.\n\n\nLearn enough to make decisions about your care.

If your doctor suspects you may have leukemia, you'll likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in blood cell diseases (hematologist).\nBecause appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of information to discuss, it's a good idea to be prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready and know what to expect from your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\nWrite down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.\nMake a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements that you're taking.\nConsider taking a family member or friend along. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.\nWrite down questions to ask your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions.

List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For acute myelogenous leukemia, some basic questions to ask include:\n\nWhat is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\nWhat are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\nWhat kinds of tests do I need?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nI have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\nAre there any restrictions that I need to follow?\nShould I seek a second opinion? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover it?\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?\nAre there brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?\nWhat will determine whether I should plan for a follow-up visit?\n\nWhat is likely causing my symptoms or condition?\nWhat are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?\nWhat kinds of tests do I need?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nI have these other health conditions.

Being ready to answer them may allow time later to cover other points you want to address. Your doctor may ask:\n\nWhen did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are your symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?\n\nWhen did you first begin experiencing symptoms?\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\nHow severe are your symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?\nAvoid activities that worsen your signs and symptoms. For instance, try to take it easy if you're feeling fatigued.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\nConsolidation therapy.\nTherapies used in these phases include:\n\n\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials. Some people with leukemia choose to enroll in clinical trials to try experimental treatments or new combinations of known therapies.\n\n\nChemotherapy.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy.

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells.

Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials.

The term \"leukemia\" can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that similar except for the fact that they affect the bone marrow and blood. You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nWrite down questions for your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nLean on family and friends. It can be difficult to talk about your diagnosis, and you'll likely get a range of reactions when you share the news. But talking about your diagnosis can be helpful. So can the outpouring of practical help that often results.\nTake care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in the tests, treatments and procedures of therapy.

The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. However, remission induction usually doesn't wipe out all of the leukemia cells, so you need further treatment to prevent the disease from returning.\nConsolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying the remaining leukemia cells. It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRemission induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow.

It's considered crucial to decreasing the risk of relapse.\nConsolidation therapy.\nTherapies used in these phases include:\n\n\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of remission induction therapy, though it can also be used for consolidation therapy. Chemotherapy uses chemicals to kill cancer cells in your body.\nPeople with AML generally stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the drugs destroy many normal blood cells in the process of killing leukemia cells. If the first cycle of chemotherapy doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n\nTargeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy and consolidation therapy.\n\nBone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, may be used for consolidation therapy. A bone marrow transplant helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\nYou can also receive your own stem cells (autologous transplant) if you were previously in remission and had your healthy stem cells removed and stored for a future transplant.\n\nClinical trials.

That leaves people with a new diagnosis faced with important decisions about a disease they may not yet understand. Here are some tips for coping:\n\n\nLearn enough to make decisions about your care. The term \"leukemia\" can be confusing because it refers to a group of cancers that aren't all that similar except for the fact that they affect the bone marrow and blood. You can waste a lot of time researching information that doesn't apply to your kind of leukemia. To avoid that, ask your doctor to write down as much information about your specific disease as possible. Then narrow your search for information accordingly.\nWrite down questions for your doctor before each appointment, and look for information in your local library and on the internet. Good sources include the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nLean on family and friends. It can be difficult to talk about your diagnosis, and you'll likely get a range of reactions when you share the news. But talking about your diagnosis can be helpful. So can the outpouring of practical help that often results.\nTake care of yourself. It's easy to get caught up in the tests, treatments and procedures of therapy.

                "Supportive treatment": "When a person has experienced known or probable exposure to a high dose of radiation from an accident or attack, medical personnel take a number of steps to determine the absorbed radiation dose. This information is essential for determining how severe the illness is likely to be, which treatments to use and whether a person is likely to survive.\n\nInformation important for determining an absorbed dose includes:\n\nKnown exposure. Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness.\nVomiting and other symptoms. The time between radiation exposure and the onset of vomiting is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before the onset of this sign, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other signs and symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose.\nBlood tests. Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and abnormal changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose.\nDosimeter. A device called a dosimeter can measure the absorbed dose of radiation but only if it was exposed to the same radiation event as the affected person.\nSurvey meter. A device such as a Geiger counter can be used to survey people to determine the body location of radioactive particles.\nType of radiation. A part of the larger emergency response to a radioactive accident or attack would include identifying the type of radiation exposure.

A part of the larger emergency response to a radioactive accident or attack would include identifying the type of radiation exposure. This information would guide some decisions for treating people with radiation sickness.\nType of radiation.\nThe treatment goals for radiation sickness are to prevent further radioactive contamination; treat life-threatening injuries, such as from burns and trauma; reduce symptoms; and manage pain.\nDecontamination involves removing external radioactive particles. Removing clothing and shoes eliminates about 90 percent of external contamination. Gently washing with water and soap removes additional radiation particles from the skin.\nDecontamination prevents radioactive materials from spreading more. It also lowers the risk of internal contamination from inhalation, ingestion or open wounds.\nA protein called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which promotes the growth of white blood cells, may counter the effect of radiation sickness on bone marrow. Treatment with this protein-based medication, which includes filgrastim (Neupogen), sargramostim (Leukine) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), may increase white blood cell production and help prevent subsequent infections.\nIf you have severe damage to bone marrow, you may also receive transfusions of red blood cells or blood platelets.\nSome treatments may reduce damage to internal organs caused by radioactive particles. Medical personnel would use these treatments only if you've been exposed to a specific type of radiation. These treatments include the following:\n\n\nPotassium iodide (ThyroShield, Iosat). This is a nonradioactive form of iodine.\nIodine is essential for proper thyroid function. If you're exposed to significant radiation, your thyroid will absorb radioactive iodine (radioiodine) just as it would other forms of iodine. The radioiodine is eventually cleared from the body in urine.\nIf you take potassium iodide, it may fill \"vacancies\" in the thyroid and prevent the absorption of radioiodine. Potassium iodide isn't a cure-all and is most effective if taken within a day of exposure.\n\nPrussian blue (Radiogardase). This type of dye binds to particles of radioactive elements known as cesium and thallium. The radioactive particles are then excreted in feces. This treatment speeds up the elimination of the radioactive particles and reduces the amount of radiation cells may absorb.\nDiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA).

Your treatment options depend on what's causing your kidney failure.\nYour doctor will also work to prevent complications and allow your kidneys time to heal. Treatments that help prevent complications include:\n\nTreatments to balance the amount of fluids in your blood. If your acute kidney failure is caused by a lack of fluids in your blood, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) fluids. In other cases, acute kidney failure may cause you to have too much fluid, leading to swelling in your arms and legs. In these cases, your doctor may recommend medications (diuretics) to cause your body to expel extra fluids.\nMedications to control blood potassium. If your kidneys aren't properly filtering potassium from your blood, your doctor may prescribe calcium, glucose or sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kionex) to prevent the accumulation of high levels of potassium in your blood. Too much potassium in the blood can cause dangerous irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and muscle weakness.\nMedications to restore blood calcium levels. If the levels of calcium in your blood drop too low, your doctor may recommend an infusion of calcium.\nDialysis to remove toxins from your blood. If toxins build up in your blood, you may need temporary hemodialysis — often referred to simply as dialysis — to help remove toxins and excess fluids from your body while your kidneys heal. Dialysis may also help remove excess potassium from your body. During dialysis, a machine pumps blood out of your body through an artificial kidney (dialyzer) that filters out waste. The blood is then returned to your body.\n\nTreatments to balance the amount of fluids in your blood.

Even if your acute sinusitis is bacterial, it may clear up without treatment. Your doctor might wait and watch to see if your acute sinusitis worsens before prescribing antibiotics.\nHowever, severe, progressive or persistent symptoms might require antibiotics. If your doctor prescribes an antibiotic, be sure to take the whole course, even after your symptoms get better. If you stop taking them early, your symptoms may recur.\nIf allergies are contributing to your sinusitis, allergy shots (immunotherapy) that help reduce the body's reaction to specific allergens may help treat your symptoms.\nThese self-help steps can help relieve sinusitis symptoms:\n\nRest. This will help your body fight infection and speed recovery.\nDrink fluids. Continue to drink plenty of fluids.\nUse a warm compress. A warm compress on your nose and forehead may help relieve the pressure in your sinuses.\nMoisten your sinus cavities. Drape a towel over your head as you breathe in the vapor from a bowl of hot water. Keep the vapor directed toward your face. Or take a hot shower, breathing in the warm, moist air. This will help ease pain and help mucus drain.\nRinse your nasal passages. Use a specially designed squeeze bottle (Sinus Rinse, others) or neti pot.

Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder may include:\n\nDetox and withdrawal. Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.\nLearning new skills and making a treatment plan. This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.\nPsychological counseling. Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.\nOral medications. A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.\nNaltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.\nInjected medication. Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.\nContinuing support. Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.\nTreatment for psychological problems. Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.\nMedical treatment for health conditions. Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.\nSpiritual practice. People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.\n\nDetox and withdrawal.

The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.\nPerform a physical exam. Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.\nSuggest lab tests and imaging tests.

And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.\nComplete a psychological evaluation.

                "What you can do": "Diagnosing drug addiction (substance use disorder) requires a thorough evaluation and often includes an assessment by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Blood, urine or other lab tests are used to assess drug use, but they're not a diagnostic test for addiction. However, these tests may be used for monitoring treatment and recovery.\n\nFor diagnosis of a substance use disorder, most mental health professionals use criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.\nAlthough there's no cure for drug addiction, treatment options explained below can help you overcome an addiction and stay drug-free. Your treatment depends on the drug used and any related medical or mental health disorders you may have. Long-term follow-up is important to prevent relapse.\nTreatment programs usually offer:\n\nIndividual, group or family therapy sessions\nA focus on understanding the nature of addiction, becoming drug-free and preventing relapse\nLevels of care and settings that vary depending on your needs, such as outpatient, residential and inpatient programs\n\nIndividual, group or family therapy sessions\nA focus on understanding the nature of addiction, becoming drug-free and preventing relapse\nLevels of care and settings that vary depending on your needs, such as outpatient, residential and inpatient programs\nThe goal of detoxification, also called \"detox\" or withdrawal therapy, is to enable you to stop taking the addicting drug as quickly and safely as possible. For some people, it may be safe to undergo withdrawal therapy on an outpatient basis. Others may need admission to a hospital or a residential treatment center.\nWithdrawal from different categories of drugs — such as depressants, stimulants or opioids — produces different side effects and requires different approaches. Detox may involve gradually reducing the dose of the drug or temporarily substituting other substances, such as methadone, buprenorphine, or a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone.\nIn an opioid overdose, naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be given by emergency responders, or in some states, by anyone who witnesses an overdose. Naloxone temporarily reverses the effects of opioid drugs.\nWhile naloxone has been on the market for years, delivery systems such as Narcan (a naloxone nasal spray) and Evzio (a naloxone injection device) are now available, though they can be very expensive.\nEvzio is a small injection device that provides voice instructions to guide the user and automatically insert the needle into the thigh to deliver the naloxone injection. Whatever the method of delivery, seek immediate medical care after using naloxone.\nAs part of a drug treatment program, behavior therapy — a form of psychotherapy — can be done by a psychologist or psychiatrist, or you may receive counseling from a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Therapy and counseling may be done with an individual, a family or a group. The therapist or counselor can: \n\nHelp you develop ways to cope with your drug cravings\nSuggest strategies to avoid drugs and prevent relapse\nOffer suggestions on how to deal with a relapse if it occurs\nTalk about issues regarding your job, legal problems, and relationships with family and friends\nInclude family members to help them develop better communication skills and be supportive\nAddress other mental health conditions\n\nHelp you develop ways to cope with your drug cravings\nSuggest strategies to avoid drugs and prevent relapse\nOffer suggestions on how to deal with a relapse if it occurs\nTalk about issues regarding your job, legal problems, and relationships with family and friends\nInclude family members to help them develop better communication skills and be supportive\nAddress other mental health conditions\nMany, though not all, self-help support groups use the 12-step model first developed by Alcoholics Anonymous.

That's partly because most people have a hard time admitting they have a problem. Yet a major component of treatment is working on acknowledging that you're a compulsive gambler.\nIf your family or your employer pressured you into therapy, you may find yourself resisting treatment. But treating a gambling problem can help you regain a sense of control — and perhaps help heal damaged relationships or finances.\nTreatment for compulsive gambling may include these approaches:\n\nTherapy. Behavior therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial. Behavior therapy uses systematic exposure to the behavior you want to unlearn and teaches you skills to reduce your urge to gamble. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on identifying unhealthy, irrational and negative beliefs and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. Family therapy also may be helpful.\nMedications. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers may help problems that often go along with compulsive gambling — such as depression, OCD or ADHD. Some antidepressants may be effective in reducing gambling behavior. Medications called narcotic antagonists, useful in treating substance abuse, may help treat compulsive gambling.\nSelf-help groups. Some people find that talking with others who have a gambling problem may be a helpful part of treatment. Ask your health care professional for advice on self-help groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and other resources.\n\nTherapy. Behavior therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial.

Treatment for substance abuse, depression, anxiety or any other mental health disorder may be part of your treatment plan for compulsive gambling.\nEven with treatment, you may return to gambling, especially if you spend time with people who gamble or you're in gambling environments. If you feel that you'll start gambling again, contact your mental health professional or sponsor right away to head off a relapse.\nThese recovery skills may help you concentrate on resisting the urges of compulsive gambling:\n\nStay focused on your No. 1 goal: not to gamble.\nTell yourself it's too risky to gamble at all. One bet typically leads to another and another.\nGive yourself permission to ask for help, as sheer willpower isn't enough to overcome compulsive gambling.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Your doctor may ask you questions or have you fill out a questionnaire to see how dependent you are on nicotine. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the right treatment plan for you. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are.\n\nLike most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt — especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to be able to stop smoking if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination.\nSome quit-smoking products are known as nicotine replacement therapy because they contain varying amounts of nicotine. Some of these nicotine replacement therapies require a prescription, but others don't. There are two approved quit-smoking medications that don't contain nicotine, and both are available only by prescription.\nAny of these products can help reduce nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms — making it more likely that you'll stop smoking for good. Using more than one may help you get better results.\nAlthough you can buy some quit-smoking products without a prescription, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor first. Together you can explore which products might be right for you, when to start taking them and possible side effects.\nMedications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to give up tobacco for good. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be.\nDuring individual or group counseling, you learn techniques you can use to help you stop smoking. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs — the most intensive treatment available.\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have not proved to be safe nor are they more effective in helping people stop smoking than nicotine replacement medications. In fact, many people who use e-cigarettes to stop smoking find themselves using both products rather than quitting.\nIt's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Steer clear of these products:\n\nDissolvable tobacco products\nSmokeless tobacco\nNicotine lollipops and balms\nCigars and pipes\nHookahs\n\nDissolvable tobacco products\nSmokeless tobacco\nNicotine lollipops and balms\nCigars and pipes\nHookahs\nSocial support is key to achieving a stable and solid, smoke-free life. Ask your family, friends and co-workers for support and encouragement. Be direct and let them know what would help you most.\nAlso consider trying these resources:\n\nSupport groups.

                "Coping and support": "Your doctor will talk to you first about your medical history and your signs and symptoms. You may undergo some of the following tests:\n\nBlood test. Tests can measure your blood levels of sodium, potassium, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce its hormones. A blood test can also measure antibodies associated with autoimmune Addison's disease.\nACTH stimulation test. ACTH signals your adrenal glands to produce cortisol. This test measures the level of cortisol in your blood before and after an injection of synthetic ACTH.\n\nInsulin-induced hypoglycemia test. You may be given this test if doctors think you may have adrenal insufficiency as a result of pituitary disease (secondary adrenal insufficiency). The test involves checking your blood sugar (blood glucose) and cortisol levels after an injection of insulin. In healthy people, glucose levels fall and cortisol levels increase.\nIn certain situations doctors may do alternative tests for secondary adrenal insufficiency, such as a low-dose ACTH stimulation test, prolonged ACTH stimulation test or glucagon stimulation test.\n\nImaging tests.

Tests can measure your blood levels of sodium, potassium, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce its hormones. A blood test can also measure antibodies associated with autoimmune Addison's disease.\nACTH stimulation test. ACTH signals your adrenal glands to produce cortisol. This test measures the level of cortisol in your blood before and after an injection of synthetic ACTH.\n\nInsulin-induced hypoglycemia test. You may be given this test if doctors think you may have adrenal insufficiency as a result of pituitary disease (secondary adrenal insufficiency). The test involves checking your blood sugar (blood glucose) and cortisol levels after an injection of insulin. In healthy people, glucose levels fall and cortisol levels increase.\nIn certain situations doctors may do alternative tests for secondary adrenal insufficiency, such as a low-dose ACTH stimulation test, prolonged ACTH stimulation test or glucagon stimulation test.\n\nImaging tests. You may undergo a computerized tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen to check the size of your adrenal glands and look for other abnormalities. You may also undergo an MRI scan of your pituitary gland if testing indicates you might have secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n\nBlood test.

You may also undergo an MRI scan of your pituitary gland if testing indicates you might have secondary adrenal insufficiency.\nImaging tests.\nAll treatment for Addison's disease involves medication. You will be given hormone replacement therapy to correct the levels of steroid hormones your body isn't producing. Some options for treatment include oral corticosteroids such as:\n\nHydrocortisone (Cortef), prednisone or methylprednisolone to replace cortisol. These hormones are given on a schedule to mimic the normal 24-hour fluctuation of cortisol levels.\nFludrocortisone acetate to replace aldosterone.\n\nHydrocortisone (Cortef), prednisone or methylprednisolone to replace cortisol. These hormones are given on a schedule to mimic the normal 24-hour fluctuation of cortisol levels.\nHydrocortisone (Cortef), prednisone or methylprednisolone\nFludrocortisone acetate to replace aldosterone.\nFludrocortisone acetate\nYou will need to get plenty of salt (sodium) in your diet, especially during heavy exercise, when the weather is hot or if you have gastrointestinal upsets, such as diarrhea.\nYour doctor will also suggest a temporary increase in your medication dosage if your body is stressed, such as from an operation, an infection or a minor illness. If you're ill with vomiting and can't keep down oral medications, you may need injections of corticosteroids.\nOther treatment recommendations include:\n\nCarry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times. A steroid emergency card and medical alert identification will let emergency medical personnel know what kind of care you need. Also have a written action plan.\nKeep extra medication handy. Missing even one day of medication may be dangerous, so keep a small supply of medication at work and with you whenever you travel.\nCarry a glucocorticoid injection kit. The kit contains a needle, syringe and injectable form of corticosteroids to use in case of emergency.\nStay in contact with your doctor. Keep an ongoing relationship with your doctor to make sure that the doses of replacement hormones are adequate, but not excessive. If you're having ongoing problems with your medications, you may need adjustments in the doses or timing of the medications.\nHave annual checkups. See your doctor or an endocrinology specialist at least once a year. Your doctor may recommend annual screening for a number of autoimmune diseases.\n\nCarry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times.

They are also working on pumps implanted under the skin that can deliver steroids in more-accurate doses.\nFuture treatment may eventually involve using adrenocortical stem cells combined with immunomodulatory treatment — modifying the immune response or the immune system — as well as gene therapy.\nSupport groups are available through the National Adrenal Diseases Foundation.\nYou're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an endocrinologist.\nBecause appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to be well-prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\nWrite down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.\nMake a list of all medications, vitamins or supplements that you're taking.\nTake a family member or friend along, if possible.
