        <h2>Diagnosis</h2><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often found when a physical exam is done for another reason or during routine medical tests, such as an ultrasound of the heart or abdomen.</p>
        <p>To diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a doctor will examine you and review your medical and family history. If your doctor thinks that you may have an aortic aneurysm, imaging tests are done to confirm the diagnosis.</p><div id="ad-mobile-top-container"></div>
        <p>Tests to diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Abdominal ultrasound.</strong> This is the most common test to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms. An abdominal ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to show how blood flows through the structures in the belly area, including the aorta.</p><p>During an abdominal ultrasound, a technician gently presses an ultrasound wand (transducer) against the belly area, moving it back and forth. The device sends signals to a computer, which creates images.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Abdominal <abbr title="Computerized tomography">CT</abbr> scan.</strong> This painless test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the structures inside the belly area. It's used to create clear images of the aorta. An abdominal <abbr title="Computerized tomography">CT</abbr> scan can also detect the size and shape of an aneurysm.</p>
        <p>During a <abbr title="Computerized tomography">CT</abbr> scan, you lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine. Sometimes, dye (contrast material) is given through a vein to make your blood vessels show up more clearly on the images.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Abdominal <abbr title="Magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr>.</strong> This imaging test uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the structures inside your belly area. Sometimes, dye (contrast material) is given through a vein to make your blood vessels more visible.</li>
        </ul>
