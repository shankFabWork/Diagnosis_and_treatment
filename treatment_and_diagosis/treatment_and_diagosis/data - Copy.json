This is the most common test to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms. An abdominal ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to show how blood flows through the structures in the belly area, including the aorta.\nDuring an abdominal ultrasound, a technician gently presses an ultrasound wand (transducer) against the belly area, moving it back and forth. The device sends signals to a computer, which creates images.\n\n\nAbdominal CT scan. This painless test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the structures inside the belly area. It's used to create clear images of the aorta. An abdominal CT scan can also detect the size and shape of an aneurysm.\nDuring a CT scan, you lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine. Sometimes, dye (contrast material) is given through a vein to make your blood vessels show up more clearly on the images.\n\nAbdominal MRI.

The device sends signals to a computer, which creates images.\n\n\nAbdominal CT scan. This painless test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the structures inside the belly area. It's used to create clear images of the aorta. An abdominal CT scan can also detect the size and shape of an aneurysm.\nDuring a CT scan, you lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine. Sometimes, dye (contrast material) is given through a vein to make your blood vessels show up more clearly on the images.\n\nAbdominal MRI.

This painless test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the structures inside the belly area. It's used to create clear images of the aorta. An abdominal CT scan can also detect the size and shape of an aneurysm.\nAbdominal CT scan.\nCT\nCT\nDuring a CT scan, you lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine.

Screening recommendations vary, but in general:\n\nMen ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked cigarettes should have a one-time screening using abdominal ultrasound.\nFor men ages 65 to 75 who have never smoked, a doctor will decide on the need for an abdominal ultrasound based on other risk factors, such as a family history of aneurysm.\n\nMen ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked cigarettes should have a one-time screening using abdominal ultrasound.\nFor men ages 65 to 75 who have never smoked, a doctor will decide on the need for an abdominal ultrasound based on other risk factors, such as a family history of aneurysm.\nThere isn't enough evidence to determine whether women ages 65 to 75 who ever smoked cigarettes or have a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm would benefit from abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. Ask your doctor if you need to have an ultrasound screening based on your risk factors. Women who have never smoked generally don't need to be screened for the condition.\nThe goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment is to prevent an aneurysm from rupturing. Treatment may involve careful monitoring or surgery. Which treatment you have depends on the size of the aortic aneurysm and how fast it's growing.\nA doctor might recommend this option, also called watchful waiting, if the abdominal aortic aneurysm is small and isn't causing symptoms. Monitoring requires regular doctor's checkups and imaging tests to determine if the aneurysm is growing and to manage other conditions, such as high blood pressure, that could worsen the aneurysm.\nTypically, a person who has a small, symptomless abdominal aortic aneurysm needs an abdominal ultrasound at least six months after diagnosis and at regular follow-up appointments.\nSurgery to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm is generally recommended if the aneurysm is 1.9 to 2.2 inches (4.8 to 5.6 centimeters) or larger, or if it's growing quickly.\nAlso, a doctor might recommend abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery if you have symptoms such as stomach pain or you have a leaking, tender or painful aneurysm.\nThe type of surgery performed depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, your age, and your overall health. Abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery options may include:\n\n\nEndovascular repair. This procedure is used most often to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through an artery in the leg and gently guides it to the aorta. A metal mesh tube (graft) on the end of the catheter is placed at the site of the aneurysm, expanded and fastened in place. The graft strengthens the weakened section of the aorta to prevent rupture of the aneurysm.\nEndovascular surgery isn't an option for everyone with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. You and your doctor will discuss the best repair option for you. After endovascular surgery, you'll need regular imaging tests to ensure that the grafted area isn't leaking.\n\nOpen abdominal surgery. This involves removing the damaged part of the aorta and replacing it with a graft, which is sewn into place. Full recovery may take a month or more.\n\n\nEndovascular repair.

If you're feeling stressed or anxious, let your doctor know so that together you can come up with the best treatment plan.\nIf you are at risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or having signs and symptoms of the condition, make an appointment with your family doctor. If you're having severe pain, seek emergency medical help.\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\nWhen you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet. Before certain tests, you might need to avoid drinking or eating for a short time.\nMake a list of:\n\nYour symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and when they began\nKey personal information, including a family history of heart disease or aneurysms\nAll medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including how much you take and when\nQuestions to ask your doctor\n\nYour symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and when they began\nYour symptoms,\nKey personal information, including a family history of heart disease or aneurysms\nKey personal information,\nAll medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including how much you take and when\nAll medications,\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nQuestions to ask\nFor an abdominal aortic aneurysm, questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\nWhat tests will I need?\nWhat treatments are available, and which do you think would be the best treatment for me?\nDo I need regular screenings, and if so, how often?\nI have other health conditions.
