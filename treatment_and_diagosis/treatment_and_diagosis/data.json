An abdominal ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to show how blood flows through the structures in the belly area, including the aorta.\nDuring an abdominal ultrasound, a technician gently presses an ultrasound wand (transducer) against the belly area, moving it back and forth. The device sends signals to a computer, which creates images.\n\n\nAbdominal CT scan. This painless test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the structures inside the belly area. It's used to create clear images of the aorta. An abdominal CT scan can also detect the size and shape of an aneurysm.\nDuring a CT scan, you lie on a table that slides into a doughnut-shaped machine.

Screening recommendations vary, but in general:\n\nMen ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked cigarettes should have a one-time screening using abdominal ultrasound.\nFor men ages 65 to 75 who have never smoked, a doctor will decide on the need for an abdominal ultrasound based on other risk factors, such as a family history of aneurysm.\n\nMen ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked cigarettes should have a one-time screening using abdominal ultrasound.\nFor men ages 65 to 75 who have never smoked, a doctor will decide on the need for an abdominal ultrasound based on other risk factors, such as a family history of aneurysm.\nThere isn't enough evidence to determine whether women ages 65 to 75 who ever smoked cigarettes or have a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm would benefit from abdominal aortic aneurysm screening. Ask your doctor if you need to have an ultrasound screening based on your risk factors. Women who have never smoked generally don't need to be screened for the condition.\nThe goal of abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment is to prevent an aneurysm from rupturing. Treatment may involve careful monitoring or surgery. Which treatment you have depends on the size of the aortic aneurysm and how fast it's growing.\nA doctor might recommend this option, also called watchful waiting, if the abdominal aortic aneurysm is small and isn't causing symptoms. Monitoring requires regular doctor's checkups and imaging tests to determine if the aneurysm is growing and to manage other conditions, such as high blood pressure, that could worsen the aneurysm.\nTypically, a person who has a small, symptomless abdominal aortic aneurysm needs an abdominal ultrasound at least six months after diagnosis and at regular follow-up appointments.\nSurgery to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm is generally recommended if the aneurysm is 1.9 to 2.2 inches (4.8 to 5.6 centimeters) or larger, or if it's growing quickly.\nAlso, a doctor might recommend abdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery if you have symptoms such as stomach pain or you have a leaking, tender or painful aneurysm.\nThe type of surgery performed depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, your age, and your overall health. Abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery options may include:\n\n\nEndovascular repair. This procedure is used most often to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm. A surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through an artery in the leg and gently guides it to the aorta. A metal mesh tube (graft) on the end of the catheter is placed at the site of the aneurysm, expanded and fastened in place. The graft strengthens the weakened section of the aorta to prevent rupture of the aneurysm.\nEndovascular surgery isn't an option for everyone with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. You and your doctor will discuss the best repair option for you. After endovascular surgery, you'll need regular imaging tests to ensure that the grafted area isn't leaking.\n\nOpen abdominal surgery. This involves removing the damaged part of the aorta and replacing it with a graft, which is sewn into place. Full recovery may take a month or more.\n\n\nEndovascular repair.

Full recovery may take a month or more.\nOpen abdominal surgery.\nLong-term survival rates are similar for both endovascular surgery and open surgery.\nFor an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a doctor will likely suggest avoiding heavy lifting and vigorous physical activity to prevent extreme increases in blood pressure, which can put more pressure on an aneurysm.\nEmotional stress can raise blood pressure, so try to avoid conflict and stressful situations. If you're feeling stressed or anxious, let your doctor know so that together you can come up with the best treatment plan.\nIf you are at risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or having signs and symptoms of the condition, make an appointment with your family doctor. If you're having severe pain, seek emergency medical help.\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\nWhen you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet. Before certain tests, you might need to avoid drinking or eating for a short time.\nMake a list of:\n\nYour symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and when they began\nKey personal information, including a family history of heart disease or aneurysms\nAll medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including how much you take and when\nQuestions to ask your doctor\n\nYour symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and when they began\nYour symptoms,\nKey personal information, including a family history of heart disease or aneurysms\nKey personal information,\nAll medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including how much you take and when\nAll medications,\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nQuestions to ask\nFor an abdominal aortic aneurysm, questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\nWhat tests will I need?\nWhat treatments are available, and which do you think would be the best treatment for me?\nDo I need regular screenings, and if so, how often?\nI have other health conditions.

Therapists who treat agoraphobia are well aware of this problem.\nIf you feel homebound due to agoraphobia, look for a therapist who can help you find alternatives to office appointments, at least in the early part of treatment. He or she may offer to see you first in your home or meet you in what you consider a safe place (safe zone). Some therapists may also offer some sessions over the phone, through email, or using computer programs or other media.\nIf the agoraphobia is so severe that you cannot access care, you might benefit from a more intensive hospital program that specializes in the treatment of anxiety.\nYou may want to take a trusted relative or friend to your appointment who can offer comfort, help and coaching, if needed.\nCertain types of antidepressants are often used to treat agoraphobia, and sometimes anti-anxiety drugs are used on a limited basis.

Anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines are sedatives that, in limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe to temporarily relieve anxiety symptoms.

Working with your therapist, you can learn how to calm and soothe yourself. Meditation, yoga, massage and visualization are simple relaxation techniques that also may help.

Some therapists may also offer some sessions over the phone, through email, or using computer programs or other media.\nIf the agoraphobia is so severe that you cannot access care, you might benefit from a more intensive hospital program that specializes in the treatment of anxiety.\nYou may want to take a trusted relative or friend to your appointment who can offer comfort, help and coaching, if needed.\nCertain types of antidepressants are often used to treat agoraphobia, and sometimes anti-anxiety drugs are used on a limited basis. Antidepressants are more effective than anti-anxiety medications in the treatment of agoraphobia.\n\nAntidepressants. Certain antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft), are used for the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia. Other types of antidepressants may also effectively treat agoraphobia.\nAnti-anxiety medication. Anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines are sedatives that, in limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe to temporarily relieve anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these drugs aren't a good choice if you've had long-term problems with anxiety or problems with alcohol or drug abuse.\n\nAntidepressants.

And you may have to try several different medications before you find one that works best for you.\nBoth starting and ending a course of antidepressants can cause side effects that create uncomfortable physical sensations or even panic attack symptoms. For this reason, your doctor likely will gradually increase your dose during treatment, and slowly decrease your dose when he or she feels you're ready to stop taking medication.\nCertain dietary and herbal supplements claim to have calming and anti-anxiety benefits. Before you take any of these for agoraphobia, talk with your doctor. Although these supplements are available without a prescription, they still pose possible health risks.\nFor example, the herbal supplement kava, also called kava kava, appeared to be a promising treatment for anxiety, but there have been reports of serious liver damage, even with short-term use. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings but not banned sales in the United States. Avoid using any product that contains kava until more-rigorous safety studies are done, especially if you have liver problems or take medications that affect your liver.\nLiving with agoraphobia can make life difficult. Professional treatment can help you overcome this disorder or manage it effectively so that you don't become a prisoner to your fears.\nYou can also take these steps to cope and care for yourself when you have agoraphobia:\n\nStick to your treatment plan. Take medications as directed. Keep therapy appointments. Communicate regularly with your therapist. Consistency can make a big difference, especially when it comes to practicing skills and taking your medication.\nTry not to avoid feared situations. It's hard to go to places or be in situations that make you uncomfortable or that bring on symptoms of anxiety. But practicing going to more and more places can make them less frightening and anxiety provoking. Family, friends and your therapist can help you work on this.\nLearn calming skills. Working with your therapist, you can learn how to calm and soothe yourself. Meditation, yoga, massage and visualization are simple relaxation techniques that also may help. Practice these techniques when you aren't anxious or worried, and then put them into action during stressful situations.\nAvoid alcohol and recreational drugs. Also limit or avoid caffeine. These substances can worsen your panic or anxiety symptoms.\nTake care of yourself. Get enough sleep, be physically active every day, and eat a healthy diet, including lots of vegetables and fruits.\nJoin a support group. Support groups for people with anxiety disorders can help you connect to others facing similar challenges and share experiences.\n\nStick to your treatment plan. Take medications as directed.

Consider starting with a phone call to your doctor or a mental health professional, or ask a trusted family member or friend to go with you to your appointment.\nTo prepare for your appointment, make a list of:\n\nAny symptoms you've been experiencing, and for how long\nThings you have stopped doing or are avoiding because of your stress\nKey personal information, especially any significant stress or life changes that you experienced around the time your symptoms first developed\nMedical information, including other physical or mental health conditions that you have\nAll medications, vitamins, herbs or other supplements you're taking, and the dosages\nQuestions to ask your doctor so that you can make the most of your appointment\n\nAny symptoms you've been experiencing, and for how long\nAny symptoms you've been experiencing,\nThings you have stopped doing or are avoiding because of your stress\nThings you have stopped doing or are avoiding\nKey personal information, especially any significant stress or life changes that you experienced around the time your symptoms first developed\nKey personal information,\nMedical information, including other physical or mental health conditions that you have\nMedical information,\nAll medications, vitamins, herbs or other supplements you're taking, and the dosages\nAll medications,\nQuestions to ask your doctor so that you can make the most of your appointment\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nSome basic questions to ask your doctor may include:\n\nWhat do you believe is causing my symptoms?\nAre there any other possible causes?\nHow will you determine my diagnosis?\nIs my condition likely temporary or long term (chronic)?\nWhat type of treatment do you recommend?\nI have other health problems.

Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss and higher risk of infections. Ask the doctor what side effects may occur during treatment, and if there are any potential long-term complications.\nChemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink tumors and make them easier to remove. It may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body.

The cancer is found only in one kidney, is completely contained within the kidney, and can be completely removed with surgery.\nStage II. The cancer has spread to the tissues and structures beyond the affected kidney, such as nearby fat or blood vessels, but it can still be completely removed by surgery.\nStage III. The cancer has spread beyond the kidney area to nearby lymph nodes or other structures within the abdomen, the tumor may spill within the abdomen before or during surgery, or it may not be completely removed by surgery.\nStage IV. The cancer has spread outside the kidney to distant structures, such as the lungs, liver, bones or brain.\nStage V. Cancer cells are found in both kidneys (bilateral tumors).\n\nStage I.

Cancer cells are found in both kidneys (bilateral tumors).\nStage V.\nTreatment for Wilms' tumor usually involves surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy. Treatments may vary by the stage of the cancer. Because this type of cancer is rare, your child's doctor may recommend that you seek treatment at a children's cancer center that has experience treating this type of cancer.\nTreatment for Wilms' tumor may begin with surgery to remove all or part of a kidney (nephrectomy). Surgery is also used to confirm the diagnosis — the tissue removed during surgery is sent to a lab to determine whether it's cancerous and what type of cancer is in the tumor.\nSurgery for Wilms' tumor may include:\n\nRemoving part of the affected kidney. Partial nephrectomy involves removal of the tumor and a small part of the kidney tissue surrounding it. Partial nephrectomy may be an option if the cancer is very small or if your child has only one functioning kidney.\nRemoving the affected kidney and surrounding tissue. In a radical nephrectomy, doctors remove the kidney and surrounding tissues, including part of the ureter and sometimes the adrenal gland. Nearby lymph nodes also are removed. The remaining kidney can increase its capacity and take over the job of filtering the blood.\nRemoving all or part of both kidneys. If the cancer affects both kidneys, the surgeon removes as much cancer as possible from both kidneys. In a small number of cases, this may mean removing both kidneys, and your child would then need kidney dialysis. If a kidney transplant is an option, your child would no longer need dialysis.\n\nRemoving part of the affected kidney.

Treatment for Wilms' tumor usually involves a combination of drugs, given through a vein, that work together to kill cancer cells.\nWhat side effects your child may experience will depend on which drugs are used. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss and higher risk of infections. Ask the doctor what side effects may occur during treatment, and if there are any potential long-term complications.\nChemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink tumors and make them easier to remove. It may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body. Chemotherapy may also be an option for children whose cancers are too advanced to be removed completely with surgery.\nFor children who have cancer in both kidneys, chemotherapy is administered before surgery. This may make it more likely that surgeons can save at least one kidney in order to preserve kidney function.\nDepending on the stage of the tumor, radiation therapy may be recommended. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells.\nDuring radiation therapy, your child is carefully positioned on a table and a large machine moves around your child, precisely aiming energy beams at the cancer. Possible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, tiredness and sunburn-like skin irritation.\nOnly a few centers in the United States, such as Mayo Clinic, offer proton beam therapy — highly targeted precision beam therapy that destroys cancer while sparing healthy tissue.\nRadiation therapy may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that weren't removed during the operation. It may also be an option to control cancer that has spread to other areas of the body, depending on where the cancer has spread.\n",

If a kidney transplant is an option, your child would no longer need dialysis.\nRemoving all or part of both kidneys.\nChemotherapy uses powerful drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. Treatment for Wilms' tumor usually involves a combination of drugs, given through a vein, that work together to kill cancer cells.\nWhat side effects your child may experience will depend on which drugs are used. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss and higher risk of infections. Ask the doctor what side effects may occur during treatment, and if there are any potential long-term complications.\nChemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink tumors and make them easier to remove. It may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body. Chemotherapy may also be an option for children whose cancers are too advanced to be removed completely with surgery.\nFor children who have cancer in both kidneys, chemotherapy is administered before surgery. This may make it more likely that surgeons can save at least one kidney in order to preserve kidney function.\nDepending on the stage of the tumor, radiation therapy may be recommended. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells.\nDuring radiation therapy, your child is carefully positioned on a table and a large machine moves around your child, precisely aiming energy beams at the cancer. Possible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, tiredness and sunburn-like skin irritation.\nOnly a few centers in the United States, such as Mayo Clinic, offer proton beam therapy — highly targeted precision beam therapy that destroys cancer while sparing healthy tissue.\nRadiation therapy may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that weren't removed during the operation. It may also be an option to control cancer that has spread to other areas of the body, depending on where the cancer has spread.\nYour child's doctor may recommend participating in a clinical trial. These research studies allow your child a chance at the latest cancer treatments, but they can't guarantee a cure.\nDiscuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your child's doctor. The majority of children with cancer enroll in a clinical trial, if available. However, enrollment in a clinical trial is up to you and your child.\nHere are some suggestions to help you guide your family through cancer treatment.\nWhen your child has medical appointments or stays in the hospital:\n\nBring a favorite toy or book to office or clinic visits, to keep your child occupied while waiting.\nStay with your child during a test or treatment, if possible. Use words that he or she will understand to describe what will happen.\nInclude play time in your child's schedule. Major hospitals usually have a playroom for children undergoing treatment. Often playroom staff members are part of the treatment team, with training in child development, recreation, psychology or social work. If your child must remain in his or her room, a child life specialist or recreational therapist may be available to make a bedside visit.\nAsk for support from clinic or hospital staff members. Seek out organizations for parents of children with cancer. Parents who have already been through this can provide encouragement and hope, as well as practical advice. Ask your child's doctor about local support groups.\n\nBring a favorite toy or book to office or clinic visits, to keep your child occupied while waiting.\nBring a favorite toy or book\nStay with your child during a test or treatment, if possible.

Ask your child's doctor about local support groups.\nAsk for support\nAfter leaving the hospital:\n\nMonitor your child's energy level outside of the hospital. If he or she feels well enough, gently encourage participation in regular activities. At times your child will seem tired or listless, particularly after chemotherapy or radiation, so make time for enough rest, too.\nKeep a daily record of your child's condition at home — body temperature, energy level, sleeping patterns, drugs administered and any side effects. Share this information with your child's doctor.\nPlan a normal diet unless your child's doctor suggests otherwise. Prepare favorite foods when possible. If your child is undergoing chemotherapy, his or her appetite may dwindle. Make sure fluid intake increases to counter the decrease in solid food intake.\nEncourage good oral hygiene for your child. A mouth rinse can be helpful for sores or areas that are bleeding. Use lip balm to soothe cracked lips. Ideally, your child should have necessary dental care before treatment begins. Afterward check with your child's doctor before scheduling visits to the dentist.\nCheck with the doctor before any vaccinations, because cancer treatment affects the immune system.\nBe prepared to talk with your other children about the illness. Tell them about changes they might see in their sibling, such as hair loss and flagging energy, and listen to their concerns.\n\nMonitor your child's energy level outside of the hospital.

The cancer has spread beyond the kidney area to nearby lymph nodes or other structures within the abdomen, the tumor may spill within the abdomen before or during surgery, or it may not be completely removed by surgery.\nStage III.\nStage IV. The cancer has spread outside the kidney to distant structures, such as the lungs, liver, bones or brain.\nStage IV.\nStage V. Cancer cells are found in both kidneys (bilateral tumors).\nStage V.\nTreatment for Wilms' tumor usually involves surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy. Treatments may vary by the stage of the cancer. Because this type of cancer is rare, your child's doctor may recommend that you seek treatment at a children's cancer center that has experience treating this type of cancer.\nTreatment for Wilms' tumor may begin with surgery to remove all or part of a kidney (nephrectomy). Surgery is also used to confirm the diagnosis — the tissue removed during surgery is sent to a lab to determine whether it's cancerous and what type of cancer is in the tumor.\nSurgery for Wilms' tumor may include:\n\nRemoving part of the affected kidney. Partial nephrectomy involves removal of the tumor and a small part of the kidney tissue surrounding it. Partial nephrectomy may be an option if the cancer is very small or if your child has only one functioning kidney.\nRemoving the affected kidney and surrounding tissue. In a radical nephrectomy, doctors remove the kidney and surrounding tissues, including part of the ureter and sometimes the adrenal gland. Nearby lymph nodes also are removed. The remaining kidney can increase its capacity and take over the job of filtering the blood.\nRemoving all or part of both kidneys. If the cancer affects both kidneys, the surgeon removes as much cancer as possible from both kidneys. In a small number of cases, this may mean removing both kidneys, and your child would then need kidney dialysis. If a kidney transplant is an option, your child would no longer need dialysis.\n\nRemoving part of the affected kidney.

If a kidney transplant is an option, your child would no longer need dialysis.\nRemoving all or part of both kidneys.\nChemotherapy uses powerful drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. Treatment for Wilms' tumor usually involves a combination of drugs, given through a vein, that work together to kill cancer cells.\nWhat side effects your child may experience will depend on which drugs are used. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss and higher risk of infections. Ask the doctor what side effects may occur during treatment, and if there are any potential long-term complications.\nChemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink tumors and make them easier to remove. It may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body. Chemotherapy may also be an option for children whose cancers are too advanced to be removed completely with surgery.\nFor children who have cancer in both kidneys, chemotherapy is administered before surgery. This may make it more likely that surgeons can save at least one kidney in order to preserve kidney function.\nDepending on the stage of the tumor, radiation therapy may be recommended. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells.\nDuring radiation therapy, your child is carefully positioned on a table and a large machine moves around your child, precisely aiming energy beams at the cancer. Possible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, tiredness and sunburn-like skin irritation.\nOnly a few centers in the United States, such as Mayo Clinic, offer proton beam therapy — highly targeted precision beam therapy that destroys cancer while sparing healthy tissue.\nRadiation therapy may be used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that weren't removed during the operation. It may also be an option to control cancer that has spread to other areas of the body, depending on where the cancer has spread.\nYour child's doctor may recommend participating in a clinical trial. These research studies allow your child a chance at the latest cancer treatments, but they can't guarantee a cure.\nDiscuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your child's doctor. The majority of children with cancer enroll in a clinical trial, if available. However, enrollment in a clinical trial is up to you and your child.\nHere are some suggestions to help you guide your family through cancer treatment.\nWhen your child has medical appointments or stays in the hospital:\n\nBring a favorite toy or book to office or clinic visits, to keep your child occupied while waiting.\nStay with your child during a test or treatment, if possible. Use words that he or she will understand to describe what will happen.\nInclude play time in your child's schedule. Major hospitals usually have a playroom for children undergoing treatment. Often playroom staff members are part of the treatment team, with training in child development, recreation, psychology or social work. If your child must remain in his or her room, a child life specialist or recreational therapist may be available to make a bedside visit.\nAsk for support from clinic or hospital staff members. Seek out organizations for parents of children with cancer. Parents who have already been through this can provide encouragement and hope, as well as practical advice. Ask your child's doctor about local support groups.\n\nBring a favorite toy or book to office or clinic visits, to keep your child occupied while waiting.\nBring a favorite toy or book\nStay with your child during a test or treatment, if possible.

If he or she feels well enough, gently encourage participation in regular activities. At times your child will seem tired or listless, particularly after chemotherapy or radiation, so make time for enough rest, too.\nKeep a daily record of your child's condition at home — body temperature, energy level, sleeping patterns, drugs administered and any side effects. Share this information with your child's doctor.\nPlan a normal diet unless your child's doctor suggests otherwise. Prepare favorite foods when possible. If your child is undergoing chemotherapy, his or her appetite may dwindle. Make sure fluid intake increases to counter the decrease in solid food intake.\nEncourage good oral hygiene for your child. A mouth rinse can be helpful for sores or areas that are bleeding. Use lip balm to soothe cracked lips. Ideally, your child should have necessary dental care before treatment begins. Afterward check with your child's doctor before scheduling visits to the dentist.\nCheck with the doctor before any vaccinations, because cancer treatment affects the immune system.\nBe prepared to talk with your other children about the illness. Tell them about changes they might see in their sibling, such as hair loss and flagging energy, and listen to their concerns.\n\nMonitor your child's energy level outside of the hospital.

Cancer survivors who experience these symptoms often score within normal ranges on memory tests.\nYour doctor may recommend blood tests, brain scans or other tests to rule out other causes of memory problems.\nChemo brain treatment focuses on coping with symptoms. In most cases, cancer-related memory problems are temporary.\n\nBecause chemo brain symptoms and severity differ from person to person, your doctor can work with you to develop an individualized approach to coping.\nCancer and cancer treatment can lead to other conditions, such as anemia, depression, sleep problems and early menopause, which may worsen memory problems. Controlling these other factors may make it easier to cope with these symptoms.\nA professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect memory and thinking (neuropsychologist) can create a plan to help you cope with chemo brain symptoms. Doctors sometimes refer to this as cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive remediation.\nLearning to adapt and cope with memory changes may involve:\n\nRepetitive exercises to train your brain. Memory and thinking exercises may help your brain repair broken circuits that may contribute to chemo brain.\nTracking and understanding what influences memory problems. Carefully tracking your memory problems may reveal ways to cope. For instance, if you become more easily distracted when you're hungry or tired, you could schedule difficult tasks that require extra concentration for the time of day when you feel your best.\nUsing coping strategies. You may learn new ways of doing everyday tasks to help you concentrate. For instance, you may learn to take notes or make an outline of written material as you read. Or a therapist may help you learn ways of speaking that help you commit conversations to memory and then retrieve those memories later.\nStress-relief techniques. Stressful situations can make memory problems more likely. And having memory problems can be stressful. To end the cycle, you may learn relaxation techniques. These techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness practices, may help you identify stress and help you cope.\n\nRepetitive exercises to train your brain.

For instance, try to:\n\nControl what you can about your working environment. If noise and commotion are contributing to your distraction, try to find a quiet place where you can concentrate. Consider earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones. Soft music may help drown out other noises.\nPrepare yourself for success. Before tackling a complicated task that requires concentration, take steps to ensure that you will have the best chance for success. Eat so you won't be distracted by hunger. Pick a time of day when you'll be the most alert. Get a good night's sleep. Have a plan so you know exactly what you'll need to do in order to complete your task.\nStay organized. Use calendars or planners to keep on task. That way you won't spend time wondering if you're forgetting an appointment or an item on your to-do list. Write everything down in your planner. Make organization a priority at home and at work, too. Having an organized work space means you can spend more time on tasks that you need to accomplish.\nClear your mind of distractions. When distracting thoughts pop up, write them down in your planner. Recording your thoughts will help to quickly clear them and ensure that you remember them later.\nTake frequent breaks. Divide your tasks into manageable portions and take a break each time you complete one part. Give yourself a short rest so that you'll be able to continue later.\nExercise your brain. Try crossword puzzles or number games to exercise your brain. Take up a new hobby or master a new skill, such as learning to play a musical instrument or learning a language.\nExercise your body. Moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, can help you cope with stress, fatigue and depression. All can contribute to memory problems.

Devote time each day to stress-relief activities, such as exercise, listening to music, meditation or writing in a journal.\nBe honest with others about your symptoms. Be open and honest with the people who are close to you about your chemo brain symptoms. Explain your symptoms and also suggest ways friends and family can help. For instance, you might ask a friend to remind you of plans by both phone and email.\n\nUnderstand that memory problems happen to everyone.

These tests can also help find colorectal cancer in its early stages, when you have a good chance of recovery.\nScreening methods include:\n\nColonoscopy, the most sensitive test for colorectal polyps and cancer. If polyps are found, your doctor may remove them immediately or take tissue samples (biopsies) for analysis.\nVirtual colonoscopy (CT colonography), a minimally invasive test that uses a CT scan to view your colon. Virtual colonoscopy requires the same bowel preparation as a colonoscopy. If a polyp is found during the CT scan, you'll need to repeat the bowel preparation for a colonoscopy to have the polyp examined and removed.\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy, in which a slender tube with a light and camera is inserted into your rectum to examine the last third of your colon (sigmoid) and rectum. The majority of the colon is not examined with this screening test, so some polyps and cancers may not be discovered.\nStool-based tests. This type of test works by checking for the presence of blood in the stool or assessing your stool DNA for evidence of a colon polyp or cancer.

                "Targeted drug therapy": "Doctors recommend certain screening tests for healthy people with no signs or symptoms in order to look for signs of colon cancer or noncancerous colon polyps. Finding colon cancer at its earliest stage provides the greatest chance for a cure. Screening has been shown to reduce your risk of dying of colon cancer.\n\nDoctors generally recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer begin screening around age 45. But people with an increased risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer or African-American heritage, should consider screening sooner.\nSeveral screening options exist — each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Talk about your options with your doctor, and together you can decide which tests are appropriate for you. If a colonoscopy is used for screening, polyps can be removed during the procedure before they turn into cancer.\nIf your signs and symptoms indicate that you could have colon cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more tests and procedures, including:\n\nUsing a scope to examine the inside of your colon (colonoscopy). Colonoscopy uses a long, flexible and slender tube attached to a video camera and monitor to view your entire colon and rectum. If any suspicious areas are found, your doctor can pass surgical tools through the tube to take tissue samples (biopsies) for analysis and remove polyps.\n\nBlood tests. No blood test can tell you if you have colon cancer.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Doctors recommend certain screening tests for healthy people with no signs or symptoms in order to look for signs of colon cancer or noncancerous colon polyps. Finding colon cancer at its earliest stage provides the greatest chance for a cure. Screening has been shown to reduce your risk of dying of colon cancer.\n\nDoctors generally recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer begin screening around age 45. But people with an increased risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer or African-American heritage, should consider screening sooner.\nSeveral screening options exist — each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Talk about your options with your doctor, and together you can decide which tests are appropriate for you. If a colonoscopy is used for screening, polyps can be removed during the procedure before they turn into cancer.\nIf your signs and symptoms indicate that you could have colon cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more tests and procedures, including:\n\nUsing a scope to examine the inside of your colon (colonoscopy). Colonoscopy uses a long, flexible and slender tube attached to a video camera and monitor to view your entire colon and rectum. If any suspicious areas are found, your doctor can pass surgical tools through the tube to take tissue samples (biopsies) for analysis and remove polyps.\n\nBlood tests. No blood test can tell you if you have colon cancer. But your doctor may test your blood for clues about your overall health, such as kidney and liver function tests.\nYour doctor may also test your blood for a chemical sometimes produced by colon cancers (carcinoembryonic antigen, or CEA). Tracked over time, the level of CEA in your blood may help your doctor understand your prognosis and whether your cancer is responding to treatment.\n\n\nUsing a scope to examine the inside of your colon (colonoscopy).

Staging helps determine what treatments are most appropriate for you.\nStaging tests may include imaging procedures such as abdominal, pelvic and chest CT scans. In many cases, the stage of your cancer may not be fully determined until after colon cancer surgery.\nThe stages of colon cancer are indicated by Roman numerals that range from 0 to IV, with the lowest stages indicating cancer that is limited to the lining of the inside of the colon. By stage IV, the cancer is considered advanced and has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body.\nWhich treatments are most likely to help you depends on your particular situation, including the location of your cancer, its stage and your other health concerns. Treatment for colon cancer usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy, might also be recommended.\nIf your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as:\n\nRemoving polyps during a colonoscopy (polypectomy). If your cancer is small, localized, completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy.\nEndoscopic mucosal resection. Larger polyps might be removed during colonoscopy using special tools to remove the polyp and a small amount of the inner lining of the colon in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection.\nMinimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic surgery). Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor.

If your cancer is small, localized, completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy.\nRemoving polyps during a colonoscopy (polypectomy).\nEndoscopic mucosal resection. Larger polyps might be removed during colonoscopy using special tools to remove the polyp and a small amount of the inner lining of the colon in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection.\nEndoscopic mucosal resection.\nMinimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic surgery). Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located.\nMinimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic surgery).\nIf the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend:\n\nPartial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy).\n\nSurgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening.\nSometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent.\n\nLymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer.\n\nPartial colectomy.

Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer.\nLymph node removal.\nIf your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as a blockage, bleeding or pain.\nIn specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver or lung but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery or other localized treatments to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of procedure. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term.\nChemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer is larger or has spread to the lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may kill any cancer cells that remain in the body and help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.\nChemotherapy might also be used before an operation to shrink a large cancer so that it's easier to remove with surgery.\nChemotherapy can also be used to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that can't be removed with surgery or that has spread to other areas of the body. Sometimes it's combined with radiation therapy.\nFor some people with low-risk stage III colon cancer, a shorter course of chemotherapy after surgery may be possible. This approach may reduce the side effects compared with the traditional course of chemotherapy, and may be just as effective.\nRadiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. It might be used to shrink a large cancer before an operation so that it can be removed more easily.\nWhen surgery isn't an option, radiation therapy might be used to relieve symptoms, such as pain. Sometimes radiation is combined with chemotherapy.\nTargeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die.\nTargeted drugs are usually combined with chemotherapy. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer.\nImmunotherapy is a drug treatment that uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that blind the immune system cells from recognizing the cancer cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.\nImmunotherapy is usually reserved for advanced colon cancer. Your doctor might have your cancer cells tested to see if they're likely to respond to this treatment.\nPalliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals that work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care.\nPalliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.\nWhen palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer.\nA cancer diagnosis can be emotionally challenging. In time, people learn to cope in their own unique ways. Until you find what works for you, you might try to:\n\nLearn enough about your cancer to feel comfortable making treatment decisions. Ask your doctor to tell you the type and stage of your cancer, as well as your treatment options and their side effects. The more you know, the more confident you'll be when it comes to making decisions about your own care. Look for information in your local library and on reliable websites.\nKeep friends and family close. Keeping your close relationships strong will help you deal with cancer. Friends and family can provide the practical support you'll need, such as helping take care of your home if you're in the hospital. And they can serve as emotional support when you feel overwhelmed.\nFind someone to talk with. Find a good listener who is willing to listen to you talk about your hopes and fears. This may be a friend or family member. The concern and understanding of a counselor, medical social worker, clergy member or cancer support group also may be helpful.\nAsk your doctor about support groups in your area or contact a cancer organization, such as the National Cancer Institute or the American Cancer Society.\n\n\nLearn enough about your cancer to feel comfortable making treatment decisions.

Denial, anger and frustration are common with chronic illnesses.\nAt times, you may need more tools to deal with your emotions. A therapist, behavioral psychologist or other professional may be able to help you put things in perspective. He or she may also be able to teach you coping skills, such as relaxation or meditation techniques.\nSometimes joining a support group, where you can share experiences and feelings with other people, is a good approach.

Steroid medications, such as prednisone, may reduce inflammation and improve mobility in the affected limb.\nCorticosteroids.\nBone-loss medications. Your provider may suggest medications to prevent or stall bone loss, such as alendronate (Binosto, Fosamax) and calcitonin (Miacalcin).\nBone-loss medications.\nSympathetic nerve-blocking medication. Injection of an anesthetic to block pain fibers in the affected nerves may relieve pain in some people.\nSympathetic nerve-blocking medication.\nIntravenous ketamine. Some studies show that low doses of intravenous ketamine, a strong anesthetic, may substantially alleviate pain.\nIntravenous ketamine.\nMedicines to lower blood pressure.

Gentle, guided exercising of the affected limbs or modifying daily activities might help decrease pain and improve range of motion and strength. The earlier the disease is diagnosed, the more effective exercises might be.\nMirror therapy. This type of therapy uses a mirror to help trick the brain. Sitting before a mirror or mirror box, you move the healthy limb so that the brain perceives it as the limb that is affected by CRPS. Research shows that this type of therapy might help improve function and reduce pain for those with CRPS.\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Chronic pain is sometimes eased by applying electrical impulses to nerve endings.\nBiofeedback. In some cases, learning biofeedback techniques may help. In biofeedback, you learn to become more aware of your body so that you can relax your body and relieve pain.\nSpinal cord stimulation. Your provider inserts tiny electrodes along your spinal cord. A small electrical current delivered to the spinal cord results in pain relief.\nIntrathecal drug pumps.

Recurrences may be treated with small doses of an antidepressant or other medication.\nCRPS\nLiving with a chronic, painful condition can be challenging, especially when — as is often the case with CRPS — your friends and family don't believe you could be feeling as much pain as you describe. Share information from reliable sources about CRPS with those close to you to help them understand what you're experiencing.\nCRPS\nCRPS\nFollow these suggestions to take care of your physical and mental health:\n\nMaintain typical daily activities as best you can.\nPace yourself and be sure to get the rest that you need.\nStay connected with friends and family.\nContinue to pursue hobbies that you enjoy and are able to do.\n\nMaintain typical daily activities as best you can.\nPace yourself and be sure to get the rest that you need.\nStay connected with friends and family.\nContinue to pursue hobbies that you enjoy and are able to do.\nIf CRPS makes it difficult for you to do things you enjoy, ask your provider about ways to get around the obstacles.\nCRPS\nKeep in mind that your physical health can directly affect your mental health. Denial, anger and frustration are common with chronic illnesses.\nAt times, you may need more tools to deal with your emotions. A therapist, behavioral psychologist or other professional may be able to help you put things in perspective. He or she may also be able to teach you coping skills, such as relaxation or meditation techniques.\nSometimes joining a support group, where you can share experiences and feelings with other people, is a good approach. Ask your provider what support groups are available in your community.\nTo get the best medical care, take time to prepare for your appointment.\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing — including the severity and location of your pain, stiffness or sensitivity. It's also a good idea to write down any questions you have for your provider.\nExamples of questions you might ask your provider include:\n\nWhat's the likely cause of my symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests, if any, do I need?\nIs my condition temporary or possibly chronic?\nWhat types of treatments are available? Which do you recommend?\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\nI have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\nIs there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing for me?\nAre there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home? What websites do you recommend?\n\nWhat's the likely cause of my symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests, if any, do I need?\nIs my condition temporary or possibly chronic?\nWhat types of treatments are available?

What websites do you recommend?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your provider, don't hesitate to ask additional questions during your appointment.\nYour provider is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may leave time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. For CRPS, your provider may ask:\nCRPS\n\nHave you had a recent accident, illness or injury, such as trauma to your limbs, a heart attack or an infection?\nHave you had surgery recently?\nWhen did you first begin experiencing pain or burning?\nHow long have you been experiencing your symptoms?\nIs the pain occasional or continuous?\nDoes anything seem to improve or worsen your symptoms?\nHave you experienced similar symptoms after past injuries?\n\nHave you had a recent accident, illness or injury, such as trauma to your limbs, a heart attack or an infection?\nHave you had surgery recently?\nWhen did you first begin experiencing pain or burning?\nHow long have you been experiencing your symptoms?\nIs the pain occasional or continuous?\nDoes anything seem to improve or worsen your symptoms?\nHave you experienced similar symptoms after past injuries?\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

You can start both physical and mental activities at levels that do not cause a major worsening of symptoms.

Testing may evaluate several factors, including your:\n\nMemory\nConcentration\nAbility to recall information\n\nMemory\nConcentration\nAbility to recall information\nBrain imaging may be recommended for some people with signs and symptoms such as severe headaches, seizures, repeated vomiting or symptoms that are becoming worse. Brain imaging may determine whether the injury is severe and has caused bleeding or swelling in the skull.\nA cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan is the standard test in adults to assess the brain right after injury. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your skull and brain.\nCT\nFor children with suspected concussion, CT scans are only used if there are specific criteria met, such as the type of injury or signs of a skull fracture. This is to avoid radiation exposure in young children.\nCT\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to identify changes in your brain or to diagnose complications that may occur after a concussion.\nAn MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of your brain.\nMRI\nYou may need to be hospitalized overnight for observation after a concussion.\nIf your doctor agrees that you may be observed at home, someone should stay with you and check on you for at least 24 hours to ensure that your symptoms aren't worsening.\nYour caregiver may need to awaken you regularly to make sure you can awaken normally.\nThere are steps you can take to help your brain heal and speed recovery.\nIn the first few days after a concussion, relative rest is the most appropriate way to allow your brain to recover. Your doctor will recommend that you physically and mentally rest to recover from a concussion.\nRelative rest, which includes limiting activities that require thinking and mental concentration, is recommended for the first two days after a concussion. However, complete rest, such as lying in a dark room and avoiding all stimuli, does not help recovery and is not recommended. In the first 48 hours, you should overall limit activities that require high mental concentration — such as playing video games, watching TV, doing schoolwork, reading, texting or using a computer — if these activities cause your symptoms to worsen.\nYou also should avoid physical activities that increase any of your symptoms, such as general physical exertion, sports or any vigorous movements, until these activities no longer provoke your symptoms.\nAfter a period of relative rest, it's recommended that you gradually increase daily activities such as screen time if you can tolerate them without triggering symptoms. You can start both physical and mental activities at levels that do not cause a major worsening of symptoms. Light exercise and physical activity as tolerated starting a few days after injury have been shown to speed recovery; however, you should avoid any activities that have a high risk of exposure to another head impact until you are fully recovered.\nYour doctor may recommend that you have shortened school days or workdays, take breaks during the day, or have modified or reduced school workloads or work assignments as you recover from a concussion. Your doctor may recommend different therapies as well, such as rehabilitation for vision, rehabilitation for balance problems, or cognitive rehabilitation for problems with thinking and memory.\nAs your symptoms improve, you may gradually add more activities that involve thinking, such as doing more schoolwork or work assignments, or increasing your time spent at school or work.\nYour doctor will tell you when it's safe for you to resume light physical activity. Usually after the first few days after injury, you're allowed to do light physical activity — such as riding a stationary bike or light jogging — before your symptoms are completely gone, so long as it doesn't significantly worsen symptoms.\nEventually, once all signs and symptoms of concussion have resolved, you and your doctor can discuss the steps you'll need to take to safely play sports again. Resuming sports too soon increases the risk of another brain injury.\nHeadaches may occur in the days or weeks after a concussion. To manage pain, ask your doctor if it's safe to take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Avoid other pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and aspirin, as these medications may increase the risk of bleeding.\nIt's important for anyone who has a head injury to be evaluated by a doctor, even if emergency care isn't required.\nIf your child has received a head injury that concerns you, call your child's doctor immediately. Depending on the signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend seeking immediate medical care.\nHere's some information to help you get ready for and make the most of your medical appointment.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions or instructions.

Your doctor may recommend different therapies as well, such as rehabilitation for vision, rehabilitation for balance problems, or cognitive rehabilitation for problems with thinking and memory.\nAs your symptoms improve, you may gradually add more activities that involve thinking, such as doing more schoolwork or work assignments, or increasing your time spent at school or work.\nYour doctor will tell you when it's safe for you to resume light physical activity. Usually after the first few days after injury, you're allowed to do light physical activity — such as riding a stationary bike or light jogging — before your symptoms are completely gone, so long as it doesn't significantly worsen symptoms.\nEventually, once all signs and symptoms of concussion have resolved, you and your doctor can discuss the steps you'll need to take to safely play sports again. Resuming sports too soon increases the risk of another brain injury.\nHeadaches may occur in the days or weeks after a concussion. To manage pain, ask your doctor if it's safe to take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Avoid other pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and aspirin, as these medications may increase the risk of bleeding.\nIt's important for anyone who has a head injury to be evaluated by a doctor, even if emergency care isn't required.\nIf your child has received a head injury that concerns you, call your child's doctor immediately. Depending on the signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend seeking immediate medical care.\nHere's some information to help you get ready for and make the most of your medical appointment.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions or instructions. The most important thing for you to do while waiting for your appointment is to avoid activities that cause or worsen your symptoms. Avoid sports or vigorous physical activities and minimize difficult, stressful or prolonged mental tasks. At the time you make the appointment, ask what steps you or your child should take to encourage recovery or prevent re-injury. Experts recommend that athletes not return to play until they have been medically evaluated.\nList any symptoms you or your child has been experiencing and how long they've been occurring.\nList key medical information, including other medical problems for which you or your child is being treated and any history of previous head injuries. Also write down the names of any medications, vitamins, supplements or other natural remedies you or your child is taking.\nTake a family member or friend along. Sometimes it can be difficult to remember all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who comes with you may recall something that you missed or forgot.\nWrite down questions to ask your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions or instructions.

How can they be managed together?\nShould a specialist be consulted? What will that cost, and will my insurance cover seeing a specialist? You may need to call your insurance provider for some of these answers.\nAre there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\n\nDo I have a concussion?\nWhat kinds of tests are needed?\nWhat treatment approach do you recommend?\nHow soon will symptoms begin to improve?\nWhat is the risk of future concussions?\nWhat is the risk of long-term complications?\nWhen will it be safe to return to competitive sports?\nWhen will it be safe to resume vigorous exercise?\nIs it safe to return to school or work?\nIs it safe to drive a car or operate power equipment?\nI have other medical problems.

This includes avoiding sports or other physical activities that increase your heart rate, such as running, or require vigorous muscle contractions, such as weightlifting.\nGradually resume your normal daily activities, including screen time, as you're able to tolerate them without significantly worsening symptoms.\nIf you have a headache, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) may ease the pain. Avoid taking other pain relievers such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) if you suspect you've had a concussion. These may increase the risk of bleeding.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n\nLegal Conditions and TermsAny use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nManage Cookies\nAdvertisingMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization and proceeds from Web advertising help support our mission.

Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition.\n\nTests may include:\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests. These tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and whether your lungs deliver enough oxygen to your blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, you blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Other tests include measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity, six-minute walk test, and pulse oximetry.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure.\nCT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer.\nArterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide.\nLaboratory tests. Lab tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, lab tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which may be the cause of COPD in some people.

Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.\nSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.\nCOPD\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers — they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.\nExamples of short-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\nExamples of long-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\nInhaled steroids\nInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:\nCOPD\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\nCombination inhalers\nSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\nCombination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\nOral steroids\nFor people who experience periods when their COPD becomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nA medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.\nCOPD\nTheophylline\nWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.\nCOPD\nAntibiotics\nRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worsening COPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worsening COPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nCOPD\n",

This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age.\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests. These tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and whether your lungs deliver enough oxygen to your blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, you blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Other tests include measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity, six-minute walk test, and pulse oximetry.\nLung (pulmonary) function tests.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure.\nChest X-ray.\nCOPD\nCT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD.

You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.\nCOPD\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers — they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.\nExamples of short-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\nExamples of long-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\nInhaled steroids\nInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD.

However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nA medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.\nCOPD\nTheophylline\nWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.\nCOPD\nAntibiotics\nRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worsening COPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention.

                "Surgery": "COPD is commonly misdiagnosed. Many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTo diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you've had to lung irritants — especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition.\n\nTests may include:\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests. These tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and whether your lungs deliver enough oxygen to your blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, you blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Other tests include measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity, six-minute walk test, and pulse oximetry.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure.\nCT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer.\nArterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide.\nLaboratory tests. Lab tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, lab tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which may be the cause of COPD in some people. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age.\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests.

Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.\nCOPD\nThe most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keep COPD from getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.\nSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.\nCOPD\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers — they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.\nExamples of short-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\nExamples of long-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\nInhaled steroids\nInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:\nCOPD\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\nCombination inhalers\nSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids.

Examples of these include:\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\nOral steroids\nFor people who experience periods when their COPD becomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nA medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.\nCOPD\nTheophylline\nWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.\nCOPD\nAntibiotics\nRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worsening COPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worsening COPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nCOPD\nDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD:\nCOPD\n\n\nOxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.\nSome people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proved to extend life.

Surgical options include:\n\n\nLung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.\nEndoscopic lung volume reduction ― a minimally invasive procedure ― has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with COPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.\n\nLung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and youꞌll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.\nBullectomy.

                "Coping and support": "COPD is commonly misdiagnosed. Many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTo diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you've had to lung irritants — especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition.\n\nTests may include:\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests. These tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and whether your lungs deliver enough oxygen to your blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, you blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Other tests include measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity, six-minute walk test, and pulse oximetry.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure.\nCT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer.\nArterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide.\nLaboratory tests. Lab tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, lab tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which may be the cause of COPD in some people. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age.\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests.

Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.\nCOPD\nThe most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keep COPD from getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.\nSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.\nCOPD\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers — they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.\nExamples of short-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\nExamples of long-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\nInhaled steroids\nInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:\nCOPD\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\nCombination inhalers\nSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\nCombination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\nOral steroids\nFor people who experience periods when their COPD becomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nA medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.\nCOPD\nTheophylline\nWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.\nCOPD\nAntibiotics\nRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worsening COPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worsening COPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nCOPD\nDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD:\nCOPD\n\n\nOxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.\nSome people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.\n\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.\nPulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worsening COPD may reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program.\n\n\n\nOxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen.

Talk to your doctor about referral to a program.\nCOPD\nEvidence supports in-hospital use of breathing devices such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), but some research now supports the benefit of its use at home. A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.\nEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.\nExacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.\nWhen exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.\nSurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:\n\n\nLung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.\nEndoscopic lung volume reduction ― a minimally invasive procedure ― has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with COPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.\n\nLung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and youꞌll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.\nBullectomy.

A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.\nEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.\nExacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.\nWhen exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.\nSurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:\n\n\nLung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.\nEndoscopic lung volume reduction ― a minimally invasive procedure ― has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with COPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.\n\nLung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and youꞌll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.\nBullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems.

                "What you can do": "COPD is commonly misdiagnosed. Many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTo diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you've had to lung irritants — especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition.\n\nTests may include:\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests. These tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and whether your lungs deliver enough oxygen to your blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, you blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Other tests include measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity, six-minute walk test, and pulse oximetry.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure.\nCT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer.\nArterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide.\nLaboratory tests. Lab tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, lab tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which may be the cause of COPD in some people. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age.\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests.

Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.\nCOPD\nThe most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to quit all smoking. Stopping smoking can keep COPD from getting worse and reducing your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.\nSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.\nCOPD\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers — they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.\nExamples of short-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\nExamples of long-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\nInhaled steroids\nInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:\nCOPD\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\nCombination inhalers\nSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\nCombination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\nOral steroids\nFor people who experience periods when their COPD becomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nA medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.\nCOPD\nTheophylline\nWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.\nCOPD\nAntibiotics\nRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worsening COPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worsening COPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nCOPD\nDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD:\nCOPD\n\n\nOxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.\nSome people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.\n\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.\nPulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worsening COPD may reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life.

And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTalk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. Also, avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible.\nSeveral kinds of medications are used to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.\nCOPD\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators are medications that usually come in inhalers — they relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both.\nExamples of short-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\n\nAlbuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others)\nIpratropium (Atrovent HFA)\nLevalbuterol (Xopenex)\nExamples of long-acting bronchodilators include:\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium (Tudorza Pressair)\nArformoterol (Brovana)\nFormoterol (Perforomist)\nIndacaterol (Arcapta Neoinhaler)\nTiotropium (Spiriva)\nSalmeterol (Serevent)\nUmeclidinium (Incruse Ellipta)\nInhaled steroids\nInhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Examples of inhaled steroids include:\nCOPD\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\n\nFluticasone (Flovent HFA)\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler)\nCombination inhalers\nSome medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Examples of these combination inhalers include:\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\n\nFluticasone and vilanterol (Breo Ellipta)\nFluticasone, umeclidinium and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\nFormoterol and budesonide (Symbicort)\nSalmeterol and fluticasone (Advair HFA, AirDuo Digihaler, others)\nCombination inhalers that include more than one type of bronchodilator also are available. Examples of these include:\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\n\nAclidinium and formoterol (Duaklir Pressair)\nAlbuterol and ipratropium (Combivent Respimat)\nFormoterol and glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere)\nGlycopyrrolate and indacaterol (Utibron)\nOlodaterol and tiotropium (Stiolto Respimat)\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol (Anoro Ellipta)\nOral steroids\nFor people who experience periods when their COPD becomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nPhosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors\nA medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss.\nCOPD\nTheophylline\nWhen other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication.\nCOPD\nAntibiotics\nRespiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat episodes of worsening COPD, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worsening COPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nCOPD\nDoctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD:\nCOPD\n\n\nOxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices that deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town.\nSome people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proved to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options.\n\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs.\nPulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worsening COPD may reduce readmission to the hospital, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life.

A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use this therapy.\nEven with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment.\nExacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing or a change in your mucus, or if you have a harder time breathing.\nWhen exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor can talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting your annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.\nSurgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include:\n\n\nLung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival.\nEndoscopic lung volume reduction ― a minimally invasive procedure ― has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat people with COPD. A tiny one-way endobronchial valve is placed in the lung, allowing the most damaged lobe to shrink so that the healthier part of the lung has more space to expand and function.\n\nLung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and youꞌll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.\nBullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.\n\n\nLung volume reduction surgery.

Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation techniques and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath.\nClear your airways. With COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help.\nExercise regularly. It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your doctor which activities are appropriate for you.\nEat healthy foods. A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion.\nAvoid smoke and air pollution. In addition to quitting smoking, it's important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs, so check daily air quality forecasts before going out.\nSee your doctor regularly. Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's important to regularly monitor your lung function. And be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD. Ask your doctor when you need the pneumococcal vaccine.

                "Reprint Permissions": "COPD is commonly misdiagnosed. Many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced.\nCOPD\nCOPD\nTo diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you've had to lung irritants — especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition.\n\nTests may include:\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests. These tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and whether your lungs deliver enough oxygen to your blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, you blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Other tests include measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity, six-minute walk test, and pulse oximetry.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure.\nCT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer.\nArterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide.\nLaboratory tests. Lab tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, lab tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which may be the cause of COPD in some people. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age.\n\nLung (pulmonary) function tests.

However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and youꞌll need to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications.\nLung transplant.\nBullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow.\nBullectomy.\nIf you have COPD, you can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to your lungs:\nCOPD\n\nControl your breathing. Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation techniques and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath.\nClear your airways. With COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help.\nExercise regularly. It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your doctor which activities are appropriate for you.\nEat healthy foods. A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion.\nAvoid smoke and air pollution. In addition to quitting smoking, it's important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs, so check daily air quality forecasts before going out.\nSee your doctor regularly. Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's important to regularly monitor your lung function. And be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD. Ask your doctor when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. Let your doctor know if you have worsening symptoms or you notice signs of infection.\n\nControl your breathing.

You may have to give up some activities you previously enjoyed. Your family and friends may have difficulty adjusting to some of the changes.\nCOPD\nIt can help to share your fears and feelings with your family, friends and doctor. You may also want to consider joining a support group for people with COPD. And you may benefit from counseling or medication if you feel depressed or overwhelmed.\nCOPD\nIf your primary care provider suspects that you have COPD, you'll likely be referred to a pulmonologist — a doctor who specializes in lung disorders.\nCOPD\nBefore your appointment, you might want to make a list of answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat symptoms are you experiencing? When did they start?\nWhat makes your symptoms worse? Better?\nDoes anyone in your family have COPD?\nHave you had any treatment for COPD? If so, what was it and did it help?\nAre you being treated for any other medical conditions?\nWhat medications and supplements do you take regularly?\n\nWhat symptoms are you experiencing?

If so, what was it and did it help?\nCOPD\nAre you being treated for any other medical conditions?\nWhat medications and supplements do you take regularly?\nYou might want to have a friend or family member accompany you to your appointment. Often, two sets of ears are better than one when you're learning about a complicated medical problem, such as COPD. Take notes if this helps.\nCOPD\nYour doctor may ask some of the following questions:\n\nHow long have you had a cough?\nDo you get short of breath easily?\nHave you noticed any wheezing when you breathe?\nDo you or have you ever smoked cigarettes?\nWould you like help in quitting?\n\nHow long have you had a cough?\nDo you get short of breath easily?\nHave you noticed any wheezing when you breathe?\nDo you or have you ever smoked cigarettes?\nWould you like help in quitting?\nYour doctor will ask additional questions based on your responses, symptoms and needs.

Your doctor can review all your medications — pills, injections, creams and inhalers — to determine if you're taking medications that can cause the disorder. If you are, you probably won't need other tests.\n\nCushing syndrome from endogenous cortisol production can be difficult to diagnose because other conditions have similar signs and symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You'll likely need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders (endocrinologist).\nYour doctor will conduct a physical exam and look for indications of Cushing syndrome, such as rounding of the face, a pad of fatty tissue between the shoulders and neck, and thin skin with bruises and stretch marks.\nIf you haven't been using a corticosteroid medication, these diagnostic tests may help pinpoint the cause:\n\n\nUrine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show whether your body is producing excessive cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Urine and blood samples will be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed.\nYour doctor might also recommend other specialized tests that involve measuring cortisol levels before and after using hormone medications to stimulate or suppress cortisol.\n\nSaliva test. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall throughout the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, levels of cortisol drop significantly in the evening. By analyzing cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected late at night, doctors can see if cortisol levels are too high.\nImaging tests. CT or MRI scans can provide images of your pituitary and adrenal glands to detect abnormalities, such as tumors.\n\nPetrosal sinus sampling.

Depression, eating disorders and alcoholism also can partially mimic Cushing syndrome.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome are designed to lower the high level of cortisol in your body. The best treatment for you depends on the cause of the syndrome. Options include:\nIf the cause of Cushing syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing syndrome signs and symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still managing the condition for which you take it. Don't reduce the dose of corticosteroid drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your doctor's supervision.\nAbruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to deficient cortisol levels. Slowly tapering off corticosteroid drugs allows your body to resume normal cortisol production.\nIf the cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor, your doctor may recommend complete surgical removal. Pituitary tumors are typically removed by a neurosurgeon, who may perform the procedure through your nose. For a tumor in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually return to normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. Your endocrinologist will use blood tests to help determine if you need cortisol replacement and when it may be stopped.\nHowever, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never return to normal adrenal function. They then need lifelong replacement therapy.\nIf the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy as well as surgery. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery.\nRadiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period, or with a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery. In the latter procedure, a large, one-time dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\nMedications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications might also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medical therapy may not completely improve all of the symptoms of excess cortisol.\nMedications to control excessive production of cortisol at the adrenal gland include ketoconazole, mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone).\nMifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nSide effects from these medications may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle aches, high blood pressure, low potassium and swelling. Some have more-serious side effects, such as neurological side effects and liver toxicity.\nNewer medications for Cushing syndrome include pasireotide (Signifor), given as a twice-daily injection, and osilodrostat (Isturisa), a pill. Other medications are being developed.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause the pituitary or adrenal gland to produce not enough of other hormones, and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is appropriate or effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol but will require lifelong replacement medications.\n",

For a tumor in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually return to normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. Your endocrinologist will use blood tests to help determine if you need cortisol replacement and when it may be stopped.\nHowever, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never return to normal adrenal function. They then need lifelong replacement therapy.\nIf the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy as well as surgery. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery.\nRadiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period, or with a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery. In the latter procedure, a large, one-time dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\nMedications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications might also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medical therapy may not completely improve all of the symptoms of excess cortisol.\nMedications to control excessive production of cortisol at the adrenal gland include ketoconazole, mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone).\nMifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nSide effects from these medications may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle aches, high blood pressure, low potassium and swelling. Some have more-serious side effects, such as neurological side effects and liver toxicity.\nNewer medications for Cushing syndrome include pasireotide (Signifor), given as a twice-daily injection, and osilodrostat (Isturisa), a pill. Other medications are being developed.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause the pituitary or adrenal gland to produce not enough of other hormones, and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is appropriate or effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol but will require lifelong replacement medications.\nThe length of your recovery from Cushing syndrome will depend on the severity and cause of your condition. You didn't develop Cushing syndrome overnight, and your symptoms won't disappear overnight, either.

                "What you can do": "Taking glucocorticoid medications is the most common cause of Cushing syndrome. Your doctor can review all your medications — pills, injections, creams and inhalers — to determine if you're taking medications that can cause the disorder. If you are, you probably won't need other tests.\n\nCushing syndrome from endogenous cortisol production can be difficult to diagnose because other conditions have similar signs and symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You'll likely need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders (endocrinologist).\nYour doctor will conduct a physical exam and look for indications of Cushing syndrome, such as rounding of the face, a pad of fatty tissue between the shoulders and neck, and thin skin with bruises and stretch marks.\nIf you haven't been using a corticosteroid medication, these diagnostic tests may help pinpoint the cause:\n\n\nUrine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show whether your body is producing excessive cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Urine and blood samples will be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed.\nYour doctor might also recommend other specialized tests that involve measuring cortisol levels before and after using hormone medications to stimulate or suppress cortisol.\n\nSaliva test. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall throughout the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, levels of cortisol drop significantly in the evening. By analyzing cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected late at night, doctors can see if cortisol levels are too high.\nImaging tests. CT or MRI scans can provide images of your pituitary and adrenal glands to detect abnormalities, such as tumors.\n\nPetrosal sinus sampling. This test can help determine whether the cause of Cushing syndrome is rooted in the pituitary or somewhere else. For the test, blood samples are taken from the veins that drain the pituitary gland (petrosal sinuses).\nA thin tube is inserted into your upper thigh or groin area while you're sedated and is threaded to the petrosal sinuses. Levels of ACTH are measured from the petrosal sinuses and from a blood sample taken from the forearm.\nIf the ACTH level is higher in the sinus sample, the problem stems from the pituitary.

                "Reprint Permissions": "Taking glucocorticoid medications is the most common cause of Cushing syndrome. Your doctor can review all your medications — pills, injections, creams and inhalers — to determine if you're taking medications that can cause the disorder. If you are, you probably won't need other tests.\n\nCushing syndrome from endogenous cortisol production can be difficult to diagnose because other conditions have similar signs and symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and extensive process. You'll likely need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders (endocrinologist).\nYour doctor will conduct a physical exam and look for indications of Cushing syndrome, such as rounding of the face, a pad of fatty tissue between the shoulders and neck, and thin skin with bruises and stretch marks.\nIf you haven't been using a corticosteroid medication, these diagnostic tests may help pinpoint the cause:\n\n\nUrine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show whether your body is producing excessive cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Urine and blood samples will be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed.\nYour doctor might also recommend other specialized tests that involve measuring cortisol levels before and after using hormone medications to stimulate or suppress cortisol.\n\nSaliva test. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall throughout the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, levels of cortisol drop significantly in the evening. By analyzing cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected late at night, doctors can see if cortisol levels are too high.\nImaging tests. CT or MRI scans can provide images of your pituitary and adrenal glands to detect abnormalities, such as tumors.\n\nPetrosal sinus sampling. This test can help determine whether the cause of Cushing syndrome is rooted in the pituitary or somewhere else. For the test, blood samples are taken from the veins that drain the pituitary gland (petrosal sinuses).\nA thin tube is inserted into your upper thigh or groin area while you're sedated and is threaded to the petrosal sinuses. Levels of ACTH are measured from the petrosal sinuses and from a blood sample taken from the forearm.\nIf the ACTH level is higher in the sinus sample, the problem stems from the pituitary. If the ACTH levels are similar between the sinuses and forearm, the root of the problem lies outside of the pituitary gland.\n\n\n\nUrine and blood tests.

Depression, eating disorders and alcoholism also can partially mimic Cushing syndrome.\nTreatments for Cushing syndrome are designed to lower the high level of cortisol in your body. The best treatment for you depends on the cause of the syndrome. Options include:\nIf the cause of Cushing syndrome is long-term use of corticosteroid medications, your doctor may be able to keep your Cushing syndrome signs and symptoms under control by reducing the dosage of the drug over a period of time, while still managing the condition for which you take it. Don't reduce the dose of corticosteroid drugs or stop taking them on your own. Do so only under your doctor's supervision.\nAbruptly discontinuing these medications could lead to deficient cortisol levels. Slowly tapering off corticosteroid drugs allows your body to resume normal cortisol production.\nIf the cause of Cushing syndrome is a tumor, your doctor may recommend complete surgical removal. Pituitary tumors are typically removed by a neurosurgeon, who may perform the procedure through your nose. For a tumor in the adrenal glands, lungs or pancreas, the surgeon can remove it through a standard operation or by using minimally invasive surgical techniques, with smaller incisions.\nAfter the operation, you'll need to take cortisol replacement medications to provide your body with the correct amount of cortisol. In most cases, you'll eventually return to normal adrenal hormone production, and your doctor can taper off the replacement drugs. Your endocrinologist will use blood tests to help determine if you need cortisol replacement and when it may be stopped.\nHowever, this process can take up to a year or longer. In some instances, people with Cushing syndrome never return to normal adrenal function. They then need lifelong replacement therapy.\nIf the surgeon can't totally remove a pituitary tumor, he or she will usually prescribe radiation therapy as well as surgery. Additionally, radiation may be used for people who aren't suitable candidates for surgery.\nRadiation can be given in small doses over a six-week period, or with a technique called stereotactic radiosurgery. In the latter procedure, a large, one-time dose of radiation is delivered to the tumor, and the radiation exposure to surrounding tissues is minimized.\nMedications can be used to control cortisol production when surgery and radiation don't work. Medications might also be used before surgery in people who have become very sick with Cushing syndrome to improve signs and symptoms and minimize surgical risk. Medical therapy may not completely improve all of the symptoms of excess cortisol.\nMedications to control excessive production of cortisol at the adrenal gland include ketoconazole, mitotane (Lysodren) and metyrapone (Metopirone).\nMifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Mifepristone does not decrease cortisol production, but it blocks the effect of cortisol on your tissues.\nSide effects from these medications may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle aches, high blood pressure, low potassium and swelling. Some have more-serious side effects, such as neurological side effects and liver toxicity.\nNewer medications for Cushing syndrome include pasireotide (Signifor), given as a twice-daily injection, and osilodrostat (Isturisa), a pill. Other medications are being developed.\nIn some cases, the tumor or its treatment will cause the pituitary or adrenal gland to produce not enough of other hormones, and your doctor will recommend hormone replacement medications.\nIf none of these treatment options is appropriate or effective, your doctor may recommend surgical removal of your adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). This procedure will cure excess production of cortisol but will require lifelong replacement medications.\nThe length of your recovery from Cushing syndrome will depend on the severity and cause of your condition. You didn't develop Cushing syndrome overnight, and your symptoms won't disappear overnight, either. In the meantime, these tips may help you on your journey back to health.\n\nIncrease activities slowly. Work up to a reasonable level of exercise or activity that feels comfortable without overdoing it. You'll improve little by little, and your persistence will be rewarded.\nEat sensibly. Nutritious foods provide a good source of fuel for your recovering body and can help you lose pounds you gained from Cushing syndrome. Make sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D. Taken together, they help your body absorb calcium, which can help strengthen your bones, counteracting the bone density loss that often occurs with Cushing syndrome.\nMonitor your mental health. Depression can be a side effect of Cushing syndrome, but it can also persist or develop after treatment begins. Don't ignore your depression or wait it out. Seek help promptly from your doctor or a therapist if you're depressed, overwhelmed or having difficulty coping during your recovery.\nGently soothe aches and pains. Hot baths, massages and low-impact exercises, such as water aerobics and tai chi, can help alleviate some of the muscle and joint pain that accompanies Cushing syndrome recovery.\n\nIncrease activities slowly.

They bring you together with other people who are coping with the same kinds of challenges, along with their families and friends, and offer a setting in which you can share common problems.\nAsk your doctor about support groups in your community. Your local health department, public library and telephone book as well as the internet also may be good sources to find a support group in your area.\nYou're likely to first see your primary care doctor. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to a doctor who specializes in hormonal disorders (endocrinologist).\nIt's a good idea to prepare for your appointment so that you can make the most of your time with your doctor. Here's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor.\n\nBe aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment, be sure to ask if there's anything you need to do in advance to prepare for diagnostic tests.\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment. For example, if you've had headaches more frequently or if you've been feeling down or more tired than usual, this is important information to share with your doctor.

                "Reprint Permissions": "Your doctor will usually talk with you about your feelings, thoughts and mental health to distinguish between a short-term case of postpartum baby blues and a more severe form of depression. Don't be embarrassed ― postpartum depression is common. Share your symptoms with your doctor so that a useful treatment plan can be created for you.\n\nAs part of your evaluation, your doctor may:\n\nDo a depression screening that may include having you fill out a questionnaire\nOrder blood tests to determine whether an underactive thyroid is contributing to your signs and symptoms\nOrder other tests, if warranted, to rule out other causes for your symptoms\n\nDo a depression screening that may include having you fill out a questionnaire\nOrder blood tests to determine whether an underactive thyroid is contributing to your signs and symptoms\nOrder other tests, if warranted, to rule out other causes for your symptoms\nTreatment and recovery time vary, depending on the severity of your depression and your individual needs. If you have an underactive thyroid or an underlying illness, your doctor may treat those conditions or refer you to the appropriate specialist. Your doctor may also refer you to a mental health professional.\nThe baby blues usually fade on their own within a few days to one to two weeks. In the meantime:\n\nGet as much rest as you can.\nAccept help from family and friends.\nConnect with other new moms.\nCreate time to take care of yourself.\nAvoid alcohol and recreational drugs, which can make mood swings worse.\n\nGet as much rest as you can.\nAccept help from family and friends.\nConnect with other new moms.\nCreate time to take care of yourself.\nAvoid alcohol and recreational drugs, which can make mood swings worse.\nPostpartum depression is often treated with psychotherapy (also called talk therapy or mental health counseling), medication or both.\n\nPsychotherapy. It may help to talk through your concerns with a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional. Through therapy, you can find better ways to cope with your feelings, solve problems, set realistic goals and respond to situations in a positive way. Sometimes family or relationship therapy also helps.\nAntidepressants. Your doctor may recommend an antidepressant. If you're breast-feeding, any medication you take will enter your breast milk. However, most antidepressants can be used during breast-feeding with little risk of side effects for your baby. Work with your doctor to weigh the potential risks and benefits of specific antidepressants.\n\nPsychotherapy.

In some cases, postpartum depression can continue, becoming chronic depression. It's important to continue treatment after you begin to feel better. Stopping treatment too early may lead to a relapse.\nPostpartum psychosis requires immediate treatment, usually in the hospital. Treatment may include:\n\nMedication. Treatment may require a combination of medications — such as antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines — to control your signs and symptoms.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT). If your postpartum depression is severe and you experience postpartum psychosis, ECT may be recommended if symptoms do not respond to medication. ECT is a procedure in which small electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reduce the symptoms of psychosis and depression, especially when other treatments have been unsuccessful.\n\nMedication.

ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reduce the symptoms of psychosis and depression, especially when other treatments have been unsuccessful.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nTreatment for postpartum psychosis can challenge a mother's ability to breast-feed. Separation from the baby makes breast-feeding difficult, and some medications used to treat postpartum psychosis aren't recommended for women who are breast-feeding. If you're experiencing postpartum psychosis, your doctor can help you work through these challenges.\nIn addition to professional treatment, you can do some things for yourself that build on your treatment plan and help speed recovery.\n\nMake healthy lifestyle choices. Include physical activity, such as a walk with your baby, and other forms of exercise in your daily routine. Try to get adequate rest. Eat healthy foods and avoid alcohol.\nSet realistic expectations. Don't pressure yourself to do everything. Scale back your expectations for the perfect household. Do what you can and leave the rest.\nMake time for yourself. Take some time for yourself and get out of the house. That may mean asking a partner to take care of the baby or arranging for a sitter. Do something you enjoy, such as a hobby or some form of entertainment. You might also schedule some time alone with your partner or friends.\nAvoid isolation. Talk with your partner, family and friends about how you're feeling. Ask other mothers about their experiences. Breaking the isolation may help you feel human again.\nAsk for help. Try to open up to the people close to you and let them know you need help. If someone offers to baby-sit, take them up on it. If you can sleep, take a nap, or maybe you can catch a movie or meet for coffee with friends. You may also benefit from asking for help with parenting skills that can include caregiving techniques to improve your baby's sleep and soothe fussing and crying.\n\nMake healthy lifestyle choices.

But remember, postpartum depression is never anyone's fault. It's a common medical condition that needs treatment.\nSo, if you're having trouble coping with postpartum depression, talk with a therapist. Ask your doctor or therapist about local support groups for new moms or women who have postpartum depression.\nThe sooner you get help, the sooner you'll be fully equipped to cope with depression and enjoy your new baby.\nAfter your first appointment, your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional who can create the right treatment plan for you.

After your procedure, you'll likely be advised to avoid activities that might jar the eyes — such as running — for a couple of weeks or so.\nIf your retina has detached, you'll need surgery to repair it, preferably within days of a diagnosis. The type of surgery your surgeon recommends will depend on several factors, including how severe the detachment is.\n\n\nInjecting air or gas into your eye. In this procedure, called pneumatic retinopexy (RET-ih-no-pek-see), the surgeon injects a bubble of air or gas into the center part of the eye (the vitreous cavity). If positioned properly, the bubble pushes the area of the retina containing the hole or holes against the wall of the eye, stopping the flow of fluid into the space behind the retina. Your doctor also uses cryopexy during the procedure to repair the retinal break.\nFluid that had collected under the retina is absorbed by itself, and the retina can then adhere to the wall of your eye. You may need to hold your head in a certain position for up to several days to keep the bubble in the proper position. The bubble eventually will reabsorb on its own.\n\n\nIndenting the surface of your eye. This procedure, called scleral (SKLAIR-ul) buckling, involves the surgeon sewing (suturing) a piece of silicone material to the white of your eye (sclera) over the affected area. This procedure indents the wall of the eye and relieves some of the force caused by the vitreous tugging on the retina.\nIf you have several tears or holes or an extensive detachment, your surgeon may create a scleral buckle that encircles your entire eye like a belt. The buckle is placed in a way that doesn't block your vision, and it usually remains in place permanently.\n\nDraining and replacing the fluid in the eye. In this procedure, called vitrectomy (vih-TREK-tuh-me), the surgeon removes the vitreous along with any tissue that is tugging on the retina. Air, gas or silicone oil is then injected into the vitreous space to help flatten the retina.\nEventually the air, gas or liquid will be absorbed, and the vitreous space will refill with body fluid. If silicone oil was used, it may be surgically removed months later.\nVitrectomy may be combined with a scleral buckling procedure.\n\nInjecting air or gas into your eye.

                "Coping and support": "Your doctor may use the following tests, instruments and procedures to diagnose retinal detachment:\n\nRetinal examination. The doctor may use an instrument with a bright light and special lenses to examine the back of your eye, including the retina. This type of device provides a highly detailed view of your whole eye, allowing the doctor to see any retinal holes, tears or detachments.\nUltrasound imaging.

If a tear is not identified at this visit, your doctor may ask you to return within a few weeks to confirm that your eye has not developed a delayed tear as a result of the same vitreous separation. Also, if you experience new symptoms, it's important to return to your doctor right away.\nSurgery is almost always used to repair a retinal tear, hole or detachment. Various techniques are available. Ask your ophthalmologist about the risks and benefits of your treatment options. Together you can determine what procedure or combination of procedures is best for you.\nWhen a retinal tear or hole hasn't yet progressed to detachment, your eye surgeon may suggest one of the following procedures to prevent retinal detachment and preserve vision.\n\nLaser surgery (photocoagulation). The surgeon directs a laser beam into the eye through the pupil. The laser makes burns around the retinal tear, creating scarring that usually \"welds\" the retina to underlying tissue.\nFreezing (cryopexy). After giving you a local anesthetic to numb your eye, the surgeon applies a freezing probe to the outer surface of the eye directly over the tear. The freezing causes a scar that helps secure the retina to the eye wall.\n\nLaser surgery (photocoagulation). The surgeon directs a laser beam into the eye through the pupil.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Your doctor may use the following tests, instruments and procedures to diagnose retinal detachment:\n\nRetinal examination. The doctor may use an instrument with a bright light and special lenses to examine the back of your eye, including the retina. This type of device provides a highly detailed view of your whole eye, allowing the doctor to see any retinal holes, tears or detachments.\nUltrasound imaging. Your doctor may use this test if bleeding has occurred in the eye, making it difficult to see your retina.\n\nRetinal examination.

Your doctor may use this test if bleeding has occurred in the eye, making it difficult to see your retina.\nUltrasound imaging.\n\nYour doctor will likely examine both eyes even if you have symptoms in just one. If a tear is not identified at this visit, your doctor may ask you to return within a few weeks to confirm that your eye has not developed a delayed tear as a result of the same vitreous separation. Also, if you experience new symptoms, it's important to return to your doctor right away.\nSurgery is almost always used to repair a retinal tear, hole or detachment. Various techniques are available. Ask your ophthalmologist about the risks and benefits of your treatment options. Together you can determine what procedure or combination of procedures is best for you.\nWhen a retinal tear or hole hasn't yet progressed to detachment, your eye surgeon may suggest one of the following procedures to prevent retinal detachment and preserve vision.\n\nLaser surgery (photocoagulation). The surgeon directs a laser beam into the eye through the pupil. The laser makes burns around the retinal tear, creating scarring that usually \"welds\" the retina to underlying tissue.\nFreezing (cryopexy). After giving you a local anesthetic to numb your eye, the surgeon applies a freezing probe to the outer surface of the eye directly over the tear. The freezing causes a scar that helps secure the retina to the eye wall.\n\nLaser surgery (photocoagulation). The surgeon directs a laser beam into the eye through the pupil.

After giving you a local anesthetic to numb your eye, the surgeon applies a freezing probe to the outer surface of the eye directly over the tear. The freezing causes a scar that helps secure the retina to the eye wall.\nFreezing (cryopexy).\nBoth of these procedures are done on an outpatient basis. After your procedure, you'll likely be advised to avoid activities that might jar the eyes — such as running — for a couple of weeks or so.\nIf your retina has detached, you'll need surgery to repair it, preferably within days of a diagnosis. The type of surgery your surgeon recommends will depend on several factors, including how severe the detachment is.\n\n\nInjecting air or gas into your eye. In this procedure, called pneumatic retinopexy (RET-ih-no-pek-see), the surgeon injects a bubble of air or gas into the center part of the eye (the vitreous cavity). If positioned properly, the bubble pushes the area of the retina containing the hole or holes against the wall of the eye, stopping the flow of fluid into the space behind the retina. Your doctor also uses cryopexy during the procedure to repair the retinal break.\nFluid that had collected under the retina is absorbed by itself, and the retina can then adhere to the wall of your eye. You may need to hold your head in a certain position for up to several days to keep the bubble in the proper position. The bubble eventually will reabsorb on its own.\n\n\nIndenting the surface of your eye. This procedure, called scleral (SKLAIR-ul) buckling, involves the surgeon sewing (suturing) a piece of silicone material to the white of your eye (sclera) over the affected area. This procedure indents the wall of the eye and relieves some of the force caused by the vitreous tugging on the retina.\nIf you have several tears or holes or an extensive detachment, your surgeon may create a scleral buckle that encircles your entire eye like a belt. The buckle is placed in a way that doesn't block your vision, and it usually remains in place permanently.\n\nDraining and replacing the fluid in the eye. In this procedure, called vitrectomy (vih-TREK-tuh-me), the surgeon removes the vitreous along with any tissue that is tugging on the retina. Air, gas or silicone oil is then injected into the vitreous space to help flatten the retina.\nEventually the air, gas or liquid will be absorbed, and the vitreous space will refill with body fluid. If silicone oil was used, it may be surgically removed months later.\nVitrectomy may be combined with a scleral buckling procedure.\n\nInjecting air or gas into your eye.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "Traveler's diarrhea may get better without any treatment. But while you're waiting, it's important to try to stay hydrated with safe liquids, such as bottled water or water with electrolytes such as an oral rehydration solution (see below). If you don't seem to be improving quickly, several medications are available to help relieve symptoms.\n\n\n\nAnti-motility agents. These medications — which include loperamide and drugs containing diphenoxylate — provide prompt but temporary relief by reducing muscle spasms in your gastrointestinal tract, slowing the transit time through your digestive system and allowing more time for absorption.\nAnti-motility medications aren't recommended for infants or people with a fever or bloody diarrhea, as they can delay clearance of the infectious organisms and make the illness worse.\nAlso, stop using anti-motility agents after 48 hours if you have abdominal pain or if your signs or symptoms worsen and your diarrhea continues. In such cases, see a doctor. You may need blood or stool tests and treatment with an antibiotic.\n\nBismuth subsalicylate. This over-the-counter medication can decrease the frequency of your stools and shorten the duration of your illness. However, it isn't recommended for children, pregnant women or people who are allergic to aspirin.\nAntibiotics. If you have more than four loose stools a day or severe symptoms, including a fever or blood, pus or mucus in your stools, a doctor may prescribe a course of antibiotics.\n\n\nAnti-motility agents.

These solutions contain water and salts in specific proportions to replenish both fluids and electrolytes. They also contain glucose to enhance absorption in the intestinal tract.\nBottled oral rehydration products are available in drugstores in developed areas, and many pharmacies carry their own brands. You can find packets of powdered oral rehydration salts, labeled World Health Organization (WHO)-ORS, at stores, pharmacies and health agencies in most countries. Reconstitute the powder in bottled or boiled water according to the directions on the package.\nIf these products are unavailable, you can prepare your own rehydrating solution in an emergency by mixing together:\n\n3/4 teaspoon table salt\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1 quart uncontaminated bottled or boiled water\nSugar-free flavor powder, such as Crystal Light (optional)\n\n3/4 teaspoon table salt\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1 quart uncontaminated bottled or boiled water\nSugar-free flavor powder, such as Crystal Light (optional)\nYou or your child can drink the solution in small amounts throughout the day as a supplement to solid foods or formula, as long as dehydration persists. Small amounts reduce the likelihood of vomiting. Breastfed infants also can drink the solution but should continue nursing on demand.\nIf dehydration symptoms — such as dry mouth, intense thirst, little or no urination, dizziness, or extreme weakness — don't improve, seek medical care right away. Oral rehydration solutions are intended only for urgent short-term use.\nIf you do get traveler's diarrhea, avoid caffeine, alcohol and dairy products, which may worsen symptoms or increase fluid loss. But keep drinking fluids.\nDrink canned fruit juices, weak tea, clear soup, decaffeinated soda or sports drinks to replace lost fluids and minerals. Later, as your diarrhea improves, try a diet of easy-to-eat complex carbohydrates, such as salted crackers, bland cereals, bananas, applesauce, dry toast or bread, rice, potatoes, and plain noodles.\nYou may return to your normal diet as you feel you can tolerate it. Add dairy products, caffeinated beverages and high-fiber foods cautiously.\nCall a doctor if you have diarrhea that is severe, lasts more than a few days or is bloody. If you are traveling, call an embassy or consulate for help locating a doctor. Other signs that you should seek medical attention include:\n\nA fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher\nPersistent vomiting\nSigns of severe dehydration, including a dry mouth, muscle cramps, decreased urine output, dizziness or fatigue\n\nA fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher\nPersistent vomiting\nSigns of severe dehydration, including a dry mouth, muscle cramps, decreased urine output, dizziness or fatigue\nIf you have diarrhea and you've just returned home from a trip abroad, share that trip information with your doctor when you call to make an appointment.\nHere's some information to help you get ready, and what to expect from your doctor.\n\nPre-appointment instructions.

DVT is most commonly treated with anticoagulants, also called blood thinners. These drugs don't break up existing blood clots, but they can prevent clots from getting bigger and reduce your risk of developing more clots.\nBlood thinners may be taken by mouth or given by IV or an injection under the skin. Heparin is typically given by IV. The most commonly used injectable blood thinners for DVT are enoxaparin (Lovenox) and fondaparinux (Arixtra).\nAfter taking an injectable blood thinner for a few days, your doctor may switch you to a pill. Examples of blood thinners that you swallow include warfarin (Jantoven) and dabigatran (Pradaxa).\nCertain blood thinners do not need to be given first with IV or injection. These drugs are rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis) or edoxaban (Savaysa). They can be started immediately after diagnosis.\nYou might need to take blood thinner pills for three months or longer. It's important to take them exactly as prescribed to prevent serious side effects.\nIf you take warfarin, you'll need regular blood tests to check how long it takes your blood to clot. Pregnant women shouldn't take certain blood-thinning medications.\n\n\nClot busters. Also called thrombolytics, these drugs might be prescribed if you have a more serious type of DVT or PE, or if other medications aren't working.\nThese drugs are given either by IV or through a tube (catheter) placed directly into the clot. Clot busters can cause serious bleeding, so they're usually only used for people with severe blood clots.\n\nFilters. If you can't take medicines to thin your blood, you might have a filter inserted into a large vein — the vena cava — in your abdomen. A vena cava filter prevents clots that break loose from lodging in your lungs.\nCompression stockings. These special knee socks reduce the chances that your blood will pool and clot. To help prevent swelling associated with deep vein thrombosis, wear them on your legs from your feet to about the level of your knees. You should wear these stockings during the day for at least two years, if possible.\n\n\nBlood thinners. DVT is most commonly treated with anticoagulants, also called blood thinners.

Tests used to diagnose or rule out a blood clot include:\nDVT\n\n\nD-dimer blood test. D dimer is a type of protein produced by blood clots. Almost all people with severe DVT have increased blood levels of D dimer. A normal result on a D-dimer test often can help rule out PE.\nDuplex ultrasound. This noninvasive test uses sound waves to create pictures of how blood flows through your veins. It's the standard test for diagnosing DVT. For the test, a technician gently moves a small hand-held device (transducer) on your skin over the body area being studied. Sometimes a series of ultrasounds are done over several days to determine whether a blood clot is growing or to check for a new one.\nVenography. A dye is injected into a large vein in your foot or ankle. An X-ray creates an image of the veins in your legs and feet, to look for clots. The test is invasive, so it's rarely performed.

                "What to expect from your doctor": "To diagnose DVT, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. You'll also have a physical exam so that your doctor can check for areas of swelling, tenderness or changes in skin color.\nDVT\nThe tests you have depend on whether your doctor thinks you are at a low or a high risk of DVT. Tests used to diagnose or rule out a blood clot include:\nDVT\n\n\nD-dimer blood test. D dimer is a type of protein produced by blood clots. Almost all people with severe DVT have increased blood levels of D dimer. A normal result on a D-dimer test often can help rule out PE.\nDuplex ultrasound. This noninvasive test uses sound waves to create pictures of how blood flows through your veins. It's the standard test for diagnosing DVT. For the test, a technician gently moves a small hand-held device (transducer) on your skin over the body area being studied. Sometimes a series of ultrasounds are done over several days to determine whether a blood clot is growing or to check for a new one.\nVenography. A dye is injected into a large vein in your foot or ankle. An X-ray creates an image of the veins in your legs and feet, to look for clots. The test is invasive, so it's rarely performed. Other tests, such as ultrasound, often are done first.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This test may be done to diagnose DVT in veins of the abdomen.\n\nD-dimer blood test.

DVT is most commonly treated with anticoagulants, also called blood thinners. These drugs don't break up existing blood clots, but they can prevent clots from getting bigger and reduce your risk of developing more clots.\nBlood thinners may be taken by mouth or given by IV or an injection under the skin. Heparin is typically given by IV. The most commonly used injectable blood thinners for DVT are enoxaparin (Lovenox) and fondaparinux (Arixtra).\nAfter taking an injectable blood thinner for a few days, your doctor may switch you to a pill. Examples of blood thinners that you swallow include warfarin (Jantoven) and dabigatran (Pradaxa).\nCertain blood thinners do not need to be given first with IV or injection. These drugs are rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis) or edoxaban (Savaysa). They can be started immediately after diagnosis.\nYou might need to take blood thinner pills for three months or longer. It's important to take them exactly as prescribed to prevent serious side effects.\nIf you take warfarin, you'll need regular blood tests to check how long it takes your blood to clot. Pregnant women shouldn't take certain blood-thinning medications.\n\n\nClot busters. Also called thrombolytics, these drugs might be prescribed if you have a more serious type of DVT or PE, or if other medications aren't working.\nThese drugs are given either by IV or through a tube (catheter) placed directly into the clot. Clot busters can cause serious bleeding, so they're usually only used for people with severe blood clots.\n\nFilters. If you can't take medicines to thin your blood, you might have a filter inserted into a large vein — the vena cava — in your abdomen. A vena cava filter prevents clots that break loose from lodging in your lungs.\nCompression stockings. These special knee socks reduce the chances that your blood will pool and clot. To help prevent swelling associated with deep vein thrombosis, wear them on your legs from your feet to about the level of your knees.

In some cases, disproportionate dwarfism may be suspected during a prenatal ultrasound if very short limbs disproportionate to the trunk are noted.\n\nDiagnostic tests may include:\n\nMeasurements. A regular part of a well-baby medical exam is the measurement of height, weight and head circumference. At each visit, your pediatrician will plot these measurements on a chart to show your child's current percentile ranking for each one. This is important for identifying abnormal growth, such as delayed growth or a disproportionately large head. If any trends in these charts are a concern, your pediatrician may make more-frequent measurements.\nAppearance. Many distinct facial and skeletal features are associated with each of several dwarfism disorders. Your child's appearance also may help your pediatrician to make a diagnosis.\nImaging technology. Your doctor may order imaging studies, such as X-rays, because certain abnormalities of the skull and skeleton can indicate which disorder your child may have. Various imaging devices may also reveal delayed maturation of bones, as is the case in growth hormone deficiency. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may reveal abnormalities of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, both of which play a role in hormone function.\nGenetic tests. Genetic tests are available for many of the known causal genes of dwarfism-related disorders, but these tests often aren't necessary to make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to suggest a test only to distinguish among possible diagnoses when other evidence is unclear or as a part of further family planning. If your pediatrician believes your daughter may have Turner syndrome, then a special lab test may be done that assesses the X chromosomes extracted from blood cells.\nFamily history. Your pediatrician may take a history of stature in siblings, parents, grandparents or other relatives to help determine whether the average range of height in your family includes short stature.\nHormone tests.

Some individuals may need lifelong therapy. The treatment may be supplemented with other related hormones if they are also deficient.\nTreatment for girls with Turner syndrome also requires estrogen and related hormone therapy in order for them to begin puberty and achieve adult sexual development.

In most cases, children receive daily injections for several years until they reach a maximum adult height — often within the average adult range for their family.\nTreatment may continue throughout the teen years and early adulthood to ensure adult maturation, such as appropriate gain in muscle or fat. Some individuals may need lifelong therapy. The treatment may be supplemented with other related hormones if they are also deficient.\nTreatment for girls with Turner syndrome also requires estrogen and related hormone therapy in order for them to begin puberty and achieve adult sexual development. Estrogen replacement therapy usually continues throughout life until women with Turner syndrome reach the average age of menopause.\nGrowth hormone supplementation for children with achondroplasia does not increase final adult height.\nRegular checkups and ongoing care by a doctor familiar with dwarfism can improve quality of life. Because of the range of symptoms and complications, treatments are tailored to address problems as they occur, such as assessment and treatment for ear infections, spinal stenosis or sleep apnea.\nAdults with dwarfism should continue to be monitored and treated for problems that occur throughout life.\n",

Disproportionate dwarfism is usually apparent at birth or early in infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or the teenage years if your child isn't growing at an expected rate.\nIt's important to take your child to all regularly scheduled well-baby visits and annual appointments throughout childhood. These visits are an opportunity for your child's doctor to track growth, note delays in expected growth and identify other problems in physical development.\nQuestions your child's doctor may ask include:\n\nWhat concerns do you have about your child's growth or development?\nHow well does he or she eat?\nIs your child reaching certain milestones in development, such as rolling over, pushing up, sitting up, crawling, walking or speaking?\nAre other members of the family very short, or have others experienced growth delays?\nDo you have your child's height marked on a measuring chart that you brought with you?\nDo you have photographs of your child at various ages that you brought with you?\n\nWhat concerns do you have about your child's growth or development?\nHow well does he or she eat?\nIs your child reaching certain milestones in development, such as rolling over, pushing up, sitting up, crawling, walking or speaking?\nAre other members of the family very short, or have others experienced growth delays?\nDo you have your child's height marked on a measuring chart that you brought with you?\nDo you have photographs of your child at various ages that you brought with you?\nIf your family doctor or pediatrician believes that your child exhibits signs of dwarfism, you may want to discuss these questions:\n\nWhat diagnostic tests will be needed?\nWhen will we learn the results of the tests?\nWhat specialists will we need to see?\nHow will you screen for disorders or complications that are commonly associated with the type of dwarfism affecting my child?\nHow will you monitor my child's health and development?\nCan you suggest educational materials and local support services for dwarfism?\n\nWhat diagnostic tests will be needed?\nWhen will we learn the results of the tests?\nWhat specialists will we need to see?\nHow will you screen for disorders or complications that are commonly associated with the type of dwarfism affecting my child?\nHow will you monitor my child's health and development?\nCan you suggest educational materials and local support services for dwarfism?\nPreparing and anticipating questions will help you make the most of your appointment time.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n                    .\n                \n",
                "Reprint Permissions": "Your pediatrician will likely examine a number of factors to assess your child's growth and determine whether he or she has a dwarfism-related disorder. In some cases, disproportionate dwarfism may be suspected during a prenatal ultrasound if very short limbs disproportionate to the trunk are noted.\n\nDiagnostic tests may include:\n\nMeasurements. A regular part of a well-baby medical exam is the measurement of height, weight and head circumference. At each visit, your pediatrician will plot these measurements on a chart to show your child's current percentile ranking for each one. This is important for identifying abnormal growth, such as delayed growth or a disproportionately large head. If any trends in these charts are a concern, your pediatrician may make more-frequent measurements.\nAppearance. Many distinct facial and skeletal features are associated with each of several dwarfism disorders. Your child's appearance also may help your pediatrician to make a diagnosis.\nImaging technology. Your doctor may order imaging studies, such as X-rays, because certain abnormalities of the skull and skeleton can indicate which disorder your child may have. Various imaging devices may also reveal delayed maturation of bones, as is the case in growth hormone deficiency. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may reveal abnormalities of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, both of which play a role in hormone function.\nGenetic tests. Genetic tests are available for many of the known causal genes of dwarfism-related disorders, but these tests often aren't necessary to make an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to suggest a test only to distinguish among possible diagnoses when other evidence is unclear or as a part of further family planning. If your pediatrician believes your daughter may have Turner syndrome, then a special lab test may be done that assesses the X chromosomes extracted from blood cells.\nFamily history. Your pediatrician may take a history of stature in siblings, parents, grandparents or other relatives to help determine whether the average range of height in your family includes short stature.\nHormone tests. Your doctor may order tests that assess levels of growth hormone or other hormones that are critical for childhood growth and development.\n\nMeasurements.

Several specialists may be involved in screening for specific conditions, making diagnoses, recommending treatments and providing care. This team may evolve as your child's needs change, and your family doctor or pediatrician can coordinate the care.\nSpecialists in your care team may include:\n\nHormone disorder specialist (endocrinologist)\nEar, nose and throat (ENT) specialist\nSpecialist in skeletal disorders (orthopedist)\nSpecialist in genetic disorders (medical geneticist)\nHeart specialist (cardiologist)\nEye specialist (ophthalmologist)\nMental health provider, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist\nNervous system abnormalities specialist (neurologist)\nDental specialist in correcting problems with teeth alignment (orthodontist)\nDevelopmental therapist, who specializes in therapy to help your child develop age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills\nOccupational therapist, who specializes in therapy to develop everyday skills and to use adaptive products that help with everyday activities\n\nHormone disorder specialist (endocrinologist)\nEar, nose and throat (ENT) specialist\nSpecialist in skeletal disorders (orthopedist)\nSpecialist in genetic disorders (medical geneticist)\nHeart specialist (cardiologist)\nEye specialist (ophthalmologist)\nMental health provider, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist\nNervous system abnormalities specialist (neurologist)\nDental specialist in correcting problems with teeth alignment (orthodontist)\nDevelopmental therapist, who specializes in therapy to help your child develop age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills\nOccupational therapist, who specializes in therapy to develop everyday skills and to use adaptive products that help with everyday activities\nThe goal of treatment is to maximize functioning and independence. Most dwarfism treatments don't increase stature but may correct or relieve problems caused by complications.\nSurgical procedures that may correct problems in people with disproportionate dwarfism include:\n\nCorrecting the direction in which bones are growing\nStabilizing and correcting the shape of the spine\nIncreasing the size of the opening in bones of the spine (vertebrae) to alleviate pressure on the spinal cord\nPlacing a shunt to remove excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus), if it occurs\n\nCorrecting the direction in which bones are growing\nStabilizing and correcting the shape of the spine\nIncreasing the size of the opening in bones of the spine (vertebrae) to alleviate pressure on the spinal cord\nPlacing a shunt to remove excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus), if it occurs\nFor individuals with dwarfism due to growth hormone deficiency, treatment with injections of a synthetic version of the hormone may increase final height. In most cases, children receive daily injections for several years until they reach a maximum adult height — often within the average adult range for their family.\nTreatment may continue throughout the teen years and early adulthood to ensure adult maturation, such as appropriate gain in muscle or fat. Some individuals may need lifelong therapy. The treatment may be supplemented with other related hormones if they are also deficient.\nTreatment for girls with Turner syndrome also requires estrogen and related hormone therapy in order for them to begin puberty and achieve adult sexual development. Estrogen replacement therapy usually continues throughout life until women with Turner syndrome reach the average age of menopause.\nGrowth hormone supplementation for children with achondroplasia does not increase final adult height.\nRegular checkups and ongoing care by a doctor familiar with dwarfism can improve quality of life. Because of the range of symptoms and complications, treatments are tailored to address problems as they occur, such as assessment and treatment for ear infections, spinal stenosis or sleep apnea.\nAdults with dwarfism should continue to be monitored and treated for problems that occur throughout life.\nSome people with dwarfism choose to undergo surgery called extended limb lengthening. This procedure is controversial for many people with dwarfism because, as with all surgeries, there are risks. Waiting to decide about limb lengthening until the person with dwarfism is old enough to participate in the decision is recommended because of the emotional and physical stress involved with multiple procedures.\nTalk with your pediatrician or a specialist about at-home care. Issues particularly critical for children with disproportionate dwarfism include:\n\nCar seats. Use an infant car seat with firm back and neck supports. Continue using a car seat in the rear-facing direction to the highest weight and height possible (and beyond the recommended age limit).\nInfant carriers and play equipment. Avoid infant devices — such as swings, umbrella strollers, carrying slings, jumper seats and backpack carriers — that don't support the neck or that curve the back into a C shape.\nAdequate head and neck support. Support your child's head and neck when he or she is seated by holding the head, neck and upper back in a safe and stable position.

                "Diagnosis": "Your doctor will consider your medical history, your signs and symptoms, and your test results when making a diagnosis of endocarditis. The diagnosis is usually based on several factors instead of a single positive test result or symptom.\nTests used to confirm or rule out endocarditis include:\n\n\nBlood culture test. A blood culture test is used to identify any germs in your bloodstream. Blood culture test results help your doctor choose the most appropriate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics.\nComplete blood count. This blood test can tell your doctor if you have a lot of white blood cells, which can be a sign of infection. A complete blood count can also help diagnose low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia), which can be a sign of endocarditis. Other blood tests also may be done to help your doctor determine the diagnosis.\n\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of your heart while it's beating. This test shows how your heart's chambers and valves are pumping blood through your heart. Your doctor may use two different types of echocardiograms to help diagnose endocarditis.\nIn a transthoracic echocardiogram, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest produce video images of your heart in motion. This test lets your doctor see the heart's structure and check it for any signs of damage.\nA transesophageal echocardiogram gives your doctor a closer look at your heart valves. During this test, a small transducer attached to the end of a tube is inserted down the tube leading from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus). This test provides much more detailed pictures of your heart than is possible with a transthoracic echocardiogram.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). An ECG is used to measure the timing and duration of your heartbeats. It isn't specifically used to diagnose endocarditis, but it can show your doctor if something is affecting your heart's electrical activity. During an ECG, sensors that can detect your heart's electrical activity are attached to your chest, arms and legs.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show your doctor the condition of your lungs and heart. It can help determine if endocarditis has caused heart swelling or if any infection has spread to your lungs.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). You may need a CT scan or an MRI scan of your brain, chest or other parts of your body if your doctor thinks that infection has spread to these areas.\n\nBlood culture test.

Other blood tests also may be done to help your doctor determine the diagnosis.\nComplete blood count.\n\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of your heart while it's beating. This test shows how your heart's chambers and valves are pumping blood through your heart. Your doctor may use two different types of echocardiograms to help diagnose endocarditis.\nIn a transthoracic echocardiogram, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest produce video images of your heart in motion. This test lets your doctor see the heart's structure and check it for any signs of damage.\nA transesophageal echocardiogram gives your doctor a closer look at your heart valves. During this test, a small transducer attached to the end of a tube is inserted down the tube leading from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus). This test provides much more detailed pictures of your heart than is possible with a transthoracic echocardiogram.\n\nEchocardiogram.

If you receive IV antibiotics, you'll generally spend a week or more in the hospital so your doctor can determine if the treatment is working.\nOnce your fever and any severe signs and symptoms have gone away, you might be able to leave the hospital and continue IV antibiotics with visits to your doctor's office or at home with home care. You'll usually take antibiotics for several weeks to clear up the infection.\nIf endocarditis is caused by a fungal infection, your doctor will prescribe antifungal medication. Some people need lifelong antifungal pills to prevent endocarditis from returning.\nHeart valve surgery may be needed to treat persistent endocarditis infections or to replace a damaged valve. Surgery is also sometimes needed to treat endocarditis that's caused by a fungal infection.\nDepending on your condition, your doctor may recommend repairing your damaged valve or replacing it with an artificial valve made of cow, pig or human heart tissue (biological tissue valve) or man-made materials (prosthetic mechanical valve).\n",

You may need a CT scan or an MRI scan of your brain, chest or other parts of your body if your doctor thinks that infection has spread to these areas.\n\nBlood culture test. A blood culture test is used to identify any germs in your bloodstream. Blood culture test results help your doctor choose the most appropriate antibiotic or combination of antibiotics.\nBlood culture test.\nComplete blood count. This blood test can tell your doctor if you have a lot of white blood cells, which can be a sign of infection. A complete blood count can also help diagnose low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia), which can be a sign of endocarditis. Other blood tests also may be done to help your doctor determine the diagnosis.\nComplete blood count.\n\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to produce images of your heart while it's beating. This test shows how your heart's chambers and valves are pumping blood through your heart. Your doctor may use two different types of echocardiograms to help diagnose endocarditis.\nIn a transthoracic echocardiogram, sound waves directed at your heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on your chest produce video images of your heart in motion. This test lets your doctor see the heart's structure and check it for any signs of damage.\nA transesophageal echocardiogram gives your doctor a closer look at your heart valves. During this test, a small transducer attached to the end of a tube is inserted down the tube leading from your mouth to your stomach (esophagus). This test provides much more detailed pictures of your heart than is possible with a transthoracic echocardiogram.\n\nEchocardiogram.

An ECG is used to measure the timing and duration of your heartbeats. It isn't specifically used to diagnose endocarditis, but it can show your doctor if something is affecting your heart's electrical activity. During an ECG, sensors that can detect your heart's electrical activity are attached to your chest, arms and legs.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).\nECG\nECG\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show your doctor the condition of your lungs and heart. It can help determine if endocarditis has caused heart swelling or if any infection has spread to your lungs.\nChest X-ray.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). You may need a CT scan or an MRI scan of your brain, chest or other parts of your body if your doctor thinks that infection has spread to these areas.\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nCT\nMRI\nMany people with endocarditis are successfully treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery may be needed to fix or replace damaged heart valves and clean up any remaining signs of the infection.\nThe type of medication you receive depends on what's causing the endocarditis.\nHigh doses of IV antibiotics are used to treat endocarditis caused by bacteria. If you receive IV antibiotics, you'll generally spend a week or more in the hospital so your doctor can determine if the treatment is working.\nOnce your fever and any severe signs and symptoms have gone away, you might be able to leave the hospital and continue IV antibiotics with visits to your doctor's office or at home with home care. You'll usually take antibiotics for several weeks to clear up the infection.\nIf endocarditis is caused by a fungal infection, your doctor will prescribe antifungal medication. Some people need lifelong antifungal pills to prevent endocarditis from returning.\nHeart valve surgery may be needed to treat persistent endocarditis infections or to replace a damaged valve. Surgery is also sometimes needed to treat endocarditis that's caused by a fungal infection.\nDepending on your condition, your doctor may recommend repairing your damaged valve or replacing it with an artificial valve made of cow, pig or human heart tissue (biological tissue valve) or man-made materials (prosthetic mechanical valve).\nThe first doctor you see will likely be your family doctor or an emergency room doctor. You may be referred to a doctor or surgeon trained in diagnosing and treating heart conditions (cardiologist).\nYou can help prepare for your appointment by taking these steps:\n\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing. Be sure to note how long you've had particular symptoms. If you've had similar symptoms that have come and gone in the past be sure to include that information.\nMake a list of your key medical information. Your doctor will need to know about any other recent health problems you've had and the names of all prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplements you're taking.\nFind a family member or friend who can come with you to the appointment. Someone who accompanies you can help remember what your doctor says.\n\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing. Be sure to note how long you've had particular symptoms.

Someone who accompanies you can help remember what your doctor says.\nFind a family member or friend who can come with you to the appointment.\nIt's also important to write down any questions you might have before you get to your appointment. For endocarditis, some basic questions you might want to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\nWhat kinds of tests do I need? How do I need to prepare for the tests?\nWhat treatment do you recommend?\nHow soon after I begin treatment will I start to feel better?\nWhat are the possible side effects?\nAm I at risk of long-term complications from this condition? Will it come back?\nHow often will I need follow-up for this condition?\nDo I need to take preventive antibiotics for certain medical or dental procedures?\nI have other medical conditions.

Dilation enables your doctor to see wider views inside of your eyes.\nThe goal of treating farsightedness is to help focus light on the retina through the use of corrective lenses or refractive surgery.\nIn young people, treatment isn't always necessary because the crystalline lenses inside the eyes are flexible enough to compensate for the condition. Depending on the degree of farsightedness, you may need prescription lenses to improve your near vision. This is especially likely as you age and the lenses inside your eyes become less flexible.\nWearing prescription lenses treats farsightedness by counteracting the decreased curvature of your cornea or the smaller size (length) of your eye. Types of prescription lenses include:\n\nEyeglasses. This is a simple, safe way to sharpen vision caused by farsightedness. The variety of eyeglass lenses is wide and includes single vision, bifocals, trifocals and progressive multifocals.\nContact lenses. These lenses are worn right on your eyes. They are available in a variety of materials and designs, including soft and rigid, gas permeable in combination with spherical, toric, multifocal and monovision designs.

Your doctor may use various instruments and ask you to look through several lenses to test your distance and close-up vision.\n\nYour eye doctor likely will put drops in your eyes to dilate your pupils for the eye health exam. This may make your eyes more light sensitive for a few hours after the exam. Dilation enables your doctor to see wider views inside of your eyes.\nThe goal of treating farsightedness is to help focus light on the retina through the use of corrective lenses or refractive surgery.\nIn young people, treatment isn't always necessary because the crystalline lenses inside the eyes are flexible enough to compensate for the condition. Depending on the degree of farsightedness, you may need prescription lenses to improve your near vision. This is especially likely as you age and the lenses inside your eyes become less flexible.\nWearing prescription lenses treats farsightedness by counteracting the decreased curvature of your cornea or the smaller size (length) of your eye. Types of prescription lenses include:\n\nEyeglasses. This is a simple, safe way to sharpen vision caused by farsightedness. The variety of eyeglass lenses is wide and includes single vision, bifocals, trifocals and progressive multifocals.\nContact lenses. These lenses are worn right on your eyes. They are available in a variety of materials and designs, including soft and rigid, gas permeable in combination with spherical, toric, multifocal and monovision designs.

These surgical treatments correct farsightedness by reshaping the curvature of your cornea. Refractive surgery methods include:\n\nLaser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). With this procedure, your eye surgeon makes a thin, hinged flap into your cornea. He or she then uses a laser to adjust the curves of the cornea that corrects the farsightedness. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually more rapid and causes less discomfort than other corneal surgeries.\nLaser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK). The surgeon creates an ultra-thin flap only in the cornea's outer protective cover (epithelium). He or she then uses a laser to reshape the cornea's outer layers, changing its curve, and then replaces the epithelium.\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK). This procedure is similar to LASEK, except the surgeon completely removes the epithelium, then uses the laser to reshape the cornea. The epithelium is not replaced, but will grow back naturally, conforming to your cornea's new shape.\n\nLaser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

                "Reprint Permissions": "Farsightedness is diagnosed by a basic eye exam, which includes a refraction assessment and an eye health exam.\nA refraction assessment determines if you have vision problems such as nearsightedness or farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia. Your doctor may use various instruments and ask you to look through several lenses to test your distance and close-up vision.\n\nYour eye doctor likely will put drops in your eyes to dilate your pupils for the eye health exam. This may make your eyes more light sensitive for a few hours after the exam. Dilation enables your doctor to see wider views inside of your eyes.\nThe goal of treating farsightedness is to help focus light on the retina through the use of corrective lenses or refractive surgery.\nIn young people, treatment isn't always necessary because the crystalline lenses inside the eyes are flexible enough to compensate for the condition. Depending on the degree of farsightedness, you may need prescription lenses to improve your near vision. This is especially likely as you age and the lenses inside your eyes become less flexible.\nWearing prescription lenses treats farsightedness by counteracting the decreased curvature of your cornea or the smaller size (length) of your eye. Types of prescription lenses include:\n\nEyeglasses. This is a simple, safe way to sharpen vision caused by farsightedness. The variety of eyeglass lenses is wide and includes single vision, bifocals, trifocals and progressive multifocals.\nContact lenses. These lenses are worn right on your eyes. They are available in a variety of materials and designs, including soft and rigid, gas permeable in combination with spherical, toric, multifocal and monovision designs. Ask your eye doctor about the pros and cons of contact lenses and what might be best for you.\n\nEyeglasses. This is a simple, safe way to sharpen vision caused by farsightedness.

Studies of people with severe frostbite show that TPA lowers the risk of amputation. But these drugs can cause serious bleeding and are typically used only in the most serious situations and within 24 hours of exposure.\nWound care. A variety of wound care techniques may be used, depending on the extent of injury.\nSurgery.

                "What you can do in the meantime": "Your doctor will likely diagnose viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu) based on symptoms, a physical exam and sometimes on the presence of similar cases in your community. A rapid stool test can detect rotavirus or norovirus, but there are no quick tests for other viruses that cause gastroenteritis. In some cases, your doctor may have you submit a stool sample to rule out a possible bacterial or parasitic infection.\n\nThere's often no specific medical treatment for viral gastroenteritis. Antibiotics aren't effective against viruses. Treatment first involves self-care measures, such as staying hydrated.\nTo help keep yourself more comfortable and prevent dehydration while you recover, try the following:\n\nLet your stomach settle. Stop eating solid foods for a few hours.\nTry sucking on ice chips or taking small sips of water often. You might also try drinking clear soda, clear broths or noncaffeinated sports drinks. In some cases you can try oral rehydration solutions. Drink plenty of liquid every day, taking small, frequent sips.\nEase back into eating. As you're able, you can return to eating your normal diet. You might find that you can eat bland, easy-to-digest foods at first, such as soda crackers, soup, oats, noodles, bananas and rice. Stop eating if your nausea returns.\nAvoid certain foods and substances until you feel better. These include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and fatty or highly seasoned foods.\nGet plenty of rest. The illness and dehydration may have made you weak and tired.\nTry anti-diarrhea medications.

These tests can show whether the goiter is associated with an increase or decrease in thyroid function.\nAntibody test. Depending on the results of the thyroid function test, your health care provider may order a blood test to detect an antibody linked to an autoimmune disorder, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease.\nUltrasonography. Ultrasonography uses sound waves to create a computerized image of tissues in your neck. The technician uses a wand-like device (transducer) over your neck to do the test. This imaging technique can reveal the size of your thyroid gland and detect nodules.\nRadioactive iodine uptake. If your health care provider orders this test, you are given a small amount of radioactive iodine. Using a special scanning device, a technician can measure the amount and rate at which your thyroid takes it in. This test may be combined with a radioactive iodine scan to show a visual image of the uptake pattern. The results may help determine function and cause of the goiter.\nBiopsy. During a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, ultrasound is used to guide a very small needle into your thyroid to obtain a tissue or fluid sample from nodules.

If your health care provider orders this test, you are given a small amount of radioactive iodine. Using a special scanning device, a technician can measure the amount and rate at which your thyroid takes it in. This test may be combined with a radioactive iodine scan to show a visual image of the uptake pattern. The results may help determine function and cause of the goiter.\nBiopsy. During a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, ultrasound is used to guide a very small needle into your thyroid to obtain a tissue or fluid sample from nodules. The samples are tested for the presence of cancerous cells.\n\nThyroid function tests. A blood sample can be used to measure the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland and how much T-4 and T-3 is produced by the thyroid. These tests can show whether the goiter is associated with an increase or decrease in thyroid function.\nThyroid function tests.\nTSH\nT-4\nT-3\nAntibody test. Depending on the results of the thyroid function test, your health care provider may order a blood test to detect an antibody linked to an autoimmune disorder, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease.\nAntibody test.\nUltrasonography.

If your goiter is small and your thyroid function is healthy, your health care provider may suggest a wait-and-see approach with regular checkups.\nMedications for goiters may include one of the following:\n\nFor increasing hormone production. An underactive thyroid is treated with a thyroid hormone replacement. The drug levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Thyquidity, others) replaces T-4 and results in the pituitary gland releasing less TSH. The drug liothyronine (Cytomel) may be prescribed as a T-3 replacement. These treatments may decrease the size of the goiter.\nFor reducing hormone production. An overactive thyroid may be treated with an anti-thyroid drug that disrupts hormone production. The most commonly used drug, methimazole (Tapazole), may also reduce the size of the goiter.\nFor blocking hormone activities. Your health care provider may prescribe a drug called a beta blocker for managing symptoms of hyperthyroidism. These drugs — including atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor) and others — can disrupt the excess thyroid hormones and lower symptoms.\nFor managing pain. If inflammation of the thyroid results in pain, it's usually treated with aspirin, naproxen sodium (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or related pain relievers. Severe pain may be treated with a steroid.\n\nFor increasing hormone production. An underactive thyroid is treated with a thyroid hormone replacement.

The dose of radioactive iodine is taken orally. The thyroid takes up the radioactive iodine, which destroys cells in the thyroid. The treatment lowers or eliminates hormone production and may decrease the size of the goiter.\nAs with surgery, you may need to take thyroid hormone replacement to maintain the appropriate levels of hormones.\nYour body gets iodine from your food. The recommended daily allowance is 150 micrograms. A teaspoon of iodized salt has about 250 micrograms of iodine.\nFoods that contain iodine include:\n\nSaltwater fish and shellfish\nSeaweed\nDairy products\nSoy products\n\nSaltwater fish and shellfish\nSeaweed\nDairy products\nSoy products\nMost people in the United States get enough iodine in a healthy diet. Too much iodine in the diet, however, can cause thyroid dysfunction.\nIf you've been diagnosed with a goiter, you're likely to have further tests to determine the cause. You might find it helpful to make a list of questions to ask your health care provider, such as:\n\nWhat caused this goiter to develop?\nIs it serious?\nWhat can be done to treat the underlying cause?\nI have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\nWhat are the alternatives to the main treatment that you're proposing?\nWhat will happen if I choose to do nothing?\nWill the goiter continue to get larger?\nHow often should I have follow-up appointments?\nWill the treatment you're suggesting improve the appearance of the goiter?\nWill I have to take medication? For how long?\n\nWhat caused this goiter to develop?\nIs it serious?\nWhat can be done to treat the underlying cause?\nI have other health conditions.

Your periodontist makes tiny incisions in your gum so that a section of gum tissue can be lifted back, exposing the roots for more effective scaling and root planing. Because periodontitis often causes bone loss, the underlying bone may be recontoured before the gum tissue is sutured back in place. After you heal, it's easier to clean these areas and maintain healthy gum tissue.\nSoft tissue grafts. When you lose gum tissue, your gumline recedes. You may need to have some of the damaged soft tissue reinforced. This is usually done by removing a small amount of tissue from the roof of your mouth (palate) or using tissue from another donor source and attaching it to the affected site. This can help reduce further gum recession, cover exposed roots and give your teeth a more pleasing appearance.\nBone grafting. This procedure is performed when periodontitis has destroyed the bone surrounding your tooth root. The graft may be composed of small fragments of your own bone, or the bone may be synthetic or donated. The bone graft helps prevent tooth loss by holding your tooth in place. It also serves as a platform for the regrowth of natural bone.\nGuided tissue regeneration. This allows the regrowth of bone that was destroyed by bacteria. In one approach, your dentist places a special piece of biocompatible fabric between existing bone and your tooth. The material prevents unwanted tissue from entering the healing area, allowing bone to grow back instead.\nTissue-stimulating proteins.

After you heal, it's easier to clean these areas and maintain healthy gum tissue.\nSoft tissue grafts. When you lose gum tissue, your gumline recedes. You may need to have some of the damaged soft tissue reinforced. This is usually done by removing a small amount of tissue from the roof of your mouth (palate) or using tissue from another donor source and attaching it to the affected site. This can help reduce further gum recession, cover exposed roots and give your teeth a more pleasing appearance.\nBone grafting. This procedure is performed when periodontitis has destroyed the bone surrounding your tooth root. The graft may be composed of small fragments of your own bone, or the bone may be synthetic or donated. The bone graft helps prevent tooth loss by holding your tooth in place. It also serves as a platform for the regrowth of natural bone.\nGuided tissue regeneration. This allows the regrowth of bone that was destroyed by bacteria. In one approach, your dentist places a special piece of biocompatible fabric between existing bone and your tooth. The material prevents unwanted tissue from entering the healing area, allowing bone to grow back instead.\nTissue-stimulating proteins.

In one approach, your dentist places a special piece of biocompatible fabric between existing bone and your tooth. The material prevents unwanted tissue from entering the healing area, allowing bone to grow back instead.\nGuided tissue regeneration.\nTissue-stimulating proteins.

This gel contains the same proteins found in developing tooth enamel and stimulates the growth of healthy bone and tissue.\nTissue-stimulating proteins.\nTry these measures to reduce or prevent periodontitis:\n\nBrush your teeth twice a day or, better yet, after every meal or snack.\nUse a soft toothbrush and replace it at least every three months.\nConsider using an electric toothbrush, which may be more effective at removing plaque and tartar.\nFloss daily.\nUse a mouth rinse to help reduce plaque between your teeth, if recommended by your dentist.\nSupplement brushing and flossing with an interdental cleaner, such as a dental pick, interdental brush or dental stick specially designed to clean between your teeth.\nGet regular professional dental cleanings, on a schedule recommended by your dentist.\nDon't smoke or chew tobacco.\n\nBrush your teeth twice a day or, better yet, after every meal or snack.\nUse a soft toothbrush and replace it at least every three months.\nConsider using an electric toothbrush, which may be more effective at removing plaque and tartar.\nFloss daily.\nUse a mouth rinse to help reduce plaque between your teeth, if recommended by your dentist.\nSupplement brushing and flossing with an interdental cleaner, such as a dental pick, interdental brush or dental stick specially designed to clean between your teeth.\nGet regular professional dental cleanings, on a schedule recommended by your dentist.\nDon't smoke or chew tobacco.\nYou may start by seeing your dentist.

Some types of hearing loss can be treated with surgery, including abnormalities of the eardrum or bones of hearing (ossicles). If you've had repeated infections with persistent fluid, your doctor may insert small tubes that help your ears drain.\nHearing aids. If your hearing loss is due to damage to your inner ear, a hearing aid can be helpful. An audiologist can discuss with you the potential benefits of a hearing aid and fit you with a device. Open fit aids are currently the most popular, due to fit and features offered.\nCochlear implants. If you have more severe hearing loss and gain limited benefit from conventional hearing aids, then a cochlear implant may be an option. Unlike a hearing aid that amplifies sound and directs it into your ear canal, a cochlear implant bypasses damaged or nonworking parts of your inner ear and directly stimulates the hearing nerve. An audiologist, along with a medical doctor who specializes in disorders of the ears, nose and throat (ENT), can discuss the risks and benefits.\n\nRemoving wax blockage.

Let them know that you have some hearing loss.\nPosition yourself to hear. Face the person you're talking to.\nTurn off background noise. For example, noise from a television may interfere with conversation.\nAsk others to speak clearly, but not more loudly. Most people will be helpful if they know you're having trouble hearing them.\nTry to have the other person's attention before speaking. Avoid trying to converse with someone in a different room.\nChoose quiet settings. In public, choose a place to talk that's away from noisy areas.\nConsider using an assistive listening device. Hearing devices, such as TV-listening systems or phone-amplifying devices, smartphone or tablet apps, and closed-circuit systems in public places can help you hear better while decreasing other noises around you.\n\nTell your friends and family.

After an initial evaluation, your doctor may refer you to a hearing specialist (audiologist).\nHere's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.\n\nWrite down your symptoms and how long you've had them. Is the hearing loss in one ear or both? Ask friends and family to help you make the list. They may have noticed changes that aren't obvious to you, but the changes may be important for your doctor to know.\nWrite down key medical information, especially related to any ear problems. Include any chronic infections, injury to your ear or previous ear surgery. Also list medications, vitamins or supplements you take.\nSummarize your work history, including any jobs, even those in the distant past, that exposed you to high noise levels.\nTake a family member or friend along. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember all the information from your doctor.\nWrite down questions for your doctor.\n\nWrite down your symptoms and how long you've had them.

Some people learn they have hemophilia after they bleed excessively during a surgical procedure.\nClotting-factor tests can reveal a clotting-factor deficiency and determine how severe the hemophilia is.\n\nFor people with a family history of hemophilia, genetic testing might be used to identify carriers to make informed decisions about becoming pregnant.\nIt's also possible to determine during pregnancy if the fetus is affected by hemophilia. However, the testing poses some risks to the fetus. Discuss the benefits and risks of testing with your doctor.\nThe main treatment for severe hemophilia involves replacing the clotting factor you need through a tube in a vein.\nThis replacement therapy can be given to treat a bleeding episode in progress. It can also be given on a regular schedule at home to help prevent bleeding episodes. Some people receive continuous replacement therapy.\nReplacement clotting factor can be made from donated blood. Similar products, called recombinant clotting factors, are made in a laboratory, not from human blood.\nOther therapies include:\n\nDesmopressin. In some forms of mild hemophilia, this hormone can stimulate the body to release more clotting factor. It can be injected slowly into a vein or used as a nasal spray.\nEmicizumab (Hemlibra). This is a newer drug that doesn't include clotting factors. This drug can help prevent bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A.\nClot-preserving medications. Also known as anti-fibrinolytics, these medications help prevent clots from breaking down.\nFibrin sealants. These can be applied directly to wound sites to promote clotting and healing. Fibrin sealants are especially useful for dental work.\nPhysical therapy. It can ease signs and symptoms if internal bleeding has damaged your joints. Severe damage might require surgery.\nFirst aid for minor cuts. Using pressure and a bandage will generally take care of the bleeding. For small areas of bleeding beneath the skin, use an ice pack.
